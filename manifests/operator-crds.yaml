                                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                          to topologies that satisfy it.
                                          It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key

                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                          Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of

                                            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the

                                          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate

                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled

                    Configures how to manage and update Gateway API CRDs.  The default behaviour - which is
                    used when this field is not set, or is set to "PreferExisting" - is that the Tigera
                    operator will create the Gateway API CRDs if they do not already exist, but will not
                    overwrite any existing Gateway API CRDs.  This setting may be preferable if the customer
                    is using other implementations of the Gateway API concurrently with the Gateway API
                    support in Calico Enterprise.  It is then the customer's responsibility to ensure that
                    CRDs are installed that meet the needs of all the Gateway API implementations in their
                    cluster.
                    Alternatively, if this field is set to "Reconcile", the Tigera operator will keep the
                    cluster's Gateway API CRDs aligned with those that it would install on a cluster that
                    does not yet have any version of those CRDs.
                  enum:
                    - Reconcile

                  description: |-
                    Reference to a custom EnvoyGateway YAML to use as the base EnvoyGateway configuration for
                    the gateway controller.  When specified, must identify a ConfigMap resource with an
                    "envoy-gateway.yaml" key whose value is the desired EnvoyGateway YAML (i.e. following the
                    same pattern as the default `envoy-gateway-config` ConfigMap).
                    When not specified, the Tigera operator uses the `envoy-gateway-config` from the Envoy
                    Gateway helm chart as its base.
                    Starting from that base, the Tigera operator copies and modifies the EnvoyGateway
                    resource as follows:
                    1. If not already specified, it sets the ControllerName to
                    "gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller".
                    2. It configures the `tigera/envoy-gateway` and `tigera/envoy-ratelimit` images that will
                    be used (according to the current Calico version, private registry and image set
                    settings) and any pull secrets that are needed to pull those images.
                    3. It enables use of the Backend API.
                    The resulting EnvoyGateway is provisioned as the `envoy-gateway-config` ConfigMap (which
                    the gateway controller then uses as its config).

                          `GatewayDeployment`, `GatewayDaemonSet` and `GatewayService` fields.
                          The resulting EnvoyProxy is provisioned in the `tigera-gateway` namespace, together with

                                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                                and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                                of pods into each bucket.
                                                We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                                Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of

                                                  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                                  skew.
                                                A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                                if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                                "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                                                If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled

                                                MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                                won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                                          This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                          Defaults to 25%.
                                          Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods
                                          immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
                                          can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
                                          that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
                                          least 70% of desired pods.

                                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                            Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                                MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                                spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                                to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                                for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                                Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                                be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                                TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                                and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                                of pods into each bucket.
                                                We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                                Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of

                                                A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                                if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                                "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                                                If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled

                                                MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                                won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                          MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                          spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                          to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                          for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                          MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                          Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                          be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                          to topologies that satisfy it.
                                          It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                          and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                          of pods into each bucket.
                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                          Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                          nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                          e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                          And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                          MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                          between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                          In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                          |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                          - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                          violate MaxSkew(1).
                                          - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                          When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                          to topologies that satisfy it.

                                          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                          When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                                      be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                      to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration

                                                      pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                                      Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                  to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                  for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                  pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                  The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                  Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                                  MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                  be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                                                  pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                            This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                            Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                            Default value is 0.
                            Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                            that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                            can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                            The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                            pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                            on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                            reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                            pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                            Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                            daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                            so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                            cause evictions during disruption.

                            starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings

                            the update.

                                    The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
                                    Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                    Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                                    This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                    Defaults to 25%.
                                    Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods
                                    immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
                                    can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
                                    that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
                                    least 70% of desired pods.

                                          The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                          or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                          scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.

                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same

                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                          and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                          of pods into each bucket.
                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                          Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                          nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                          e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                          And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                          WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                          the spread constraint.
                                          - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                            skew.
                                          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                          won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                                          MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                          be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                                can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                                Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                Default value is 0.
                                Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                cause evictions during disruption.

                                Default value is 1.

                                can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                the update.

                                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                              to topologies that satisfy it.
                                              It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                                              We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                              We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                      to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                      for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                      pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                      The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                      Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                          Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                          And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                          this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                          As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                          If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                          Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                          The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                          In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                          it will violate MaxSkew.

                                          TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                          and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                          We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                          of pods into each bucket.
                                          We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                          Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                          nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                          e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                          And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                          the spread constraint.
                                          - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                          - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                            but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                            skew.
                                          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                          if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                          "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                          labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                          | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                          | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                          If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                          to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                          MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                          won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                    The relative precedence of egress rules within a single CNP object
                    (all of which share the priority) will be determined by the order
                    in which the rule is written.
                    Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
                    would take the highest precedence.
                    CNPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                            with an unknown field.  In that case it should fail closed.

                    would take the highest precedence.
                    CNPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.

                            high-layers e.g. service mesh.

                            processed.

                            current tier for the selected traffic, and passes
                            evaluation to the next tier.

                    higher precedence, and are checked before policies with higher priority
                    values in the same tier. All Admin tier rules have higher precedence than

                    could match a connection, then the implementation can apply any of the
                    matching policies to the connection, and there is no way for the user to
                    reliably determine which one it will choose. Administrators must be
                    careful about assigning the priorities for policies with rules that will
                    match many connections, and ensure that policies have unique priority

                    Tier is used as the top-level grouping for network policy prioritization.

                    Policy tiers are evaluated in the following order:
                    * Admin tier
                    * NetworkPolicy tier
                    * Baseline tier

                    ClusterNetworkPolicy can use 2 of these tiers: Admin and Baseline.

                    The Admin tier takes precedence over all other policies. Policies
                    defined in this tier are used to set cluster-wide security rules
                    that cannot be overridden in the other tiers. If Admin tier has
                    made a final decision (Accept or Deny) on a connection, then no
                    further evaluation is done.

                    NetworkPolicy tier is the tier for the namespaced v1.NetworkPolicy.
                    These policies are intended for the application developer to describe
                    the security policy associated with their deployments inside their
                    namespace. v1.NetworkPolicy always makes a final decision for selected
                    pods. Further evaluation only happens for Pods not selected by a
                    v1.NetworkPolicy.

                    Baseline tier is a cluster-wide policy that can be overridden by the
                    v1.NetworkPolicy. If Baseline tier has made a final decision (Accept or
                    Deny) on a connection, then no further evaluation is done.

                    If a given connection wasn't allowed or denied by any of the tiers,
                    the default kubernetes policy is applied, which says that
                    all pods can communicate with each other.
