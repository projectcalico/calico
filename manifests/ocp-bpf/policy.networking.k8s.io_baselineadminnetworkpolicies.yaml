                  Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods if
                  they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules.
                  A total of 100 Egress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance.
                  The relative precedence of egress rules within a single BANP object
                  will be determined by the order in which the rule is written.
                  Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
                  would take the highest precedence.
                  BANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                              well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow

                              add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
