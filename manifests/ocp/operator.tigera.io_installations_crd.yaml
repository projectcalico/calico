                              pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes.

                              minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod on that node

                              or is drained) an updated pod is immediatedly created

                              surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed
                              by the daemonset on any given node can double if the
                              readiness check fails, and so resource intensive daemonsets
                              should take into account that they may cause evictions

                        is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current
                        state of the instance.
