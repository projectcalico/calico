#### Bug fixes

 - Don't run pprof on prometheus metrics port [calico #9224](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9224) (@coutinhop)
 - ebpf: Fix for Istio ambient mode - traffic that arrives from host should go back through host and not skip iptables [calico #9199](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9199) (@tomastigera)
 - [etcd mode] Fix issue where Calico nodes failed to decommission if calico-kube-controllers was running on the terminated node. [calico #9197](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9197) (@caseydavenport)
 - ebpf: Attach XDP to bond slave devices. [calico #9143](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9143) (@sridhartigera)
 - BGP: Prevent the advertisement of local kernel routes learned from eBPF interfaces (bpf*.cali) to peers. [calico #9127](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9127) (@mazdakn)
 - Fix Felix panic when using non-default BPF map sizes.  Size was not updated in all places resulting in failure to attach programs. [calico #9118](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9118) (@sridhartigera)
 - Fix interaction between kube-proxy and Calico's SNAT rules that could cause corrupted VXLAN packets when checksum offload was enabled.  Move Calico's rules after kube-proxy's to make sure kube-proxy's mark bit is cleared if both would have done SNAT. [calico #9102](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9102) (@tomastigera)
 - Fix missing resources in calioctl command help text [calico #9095](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9095) (@caseydavenport)
 - ebpf: Fix parsing host IP update and re-attach program on all interfaces when there is a host IP update; fix frequently attaching BPF programs when pods annotations/labels change and eventually failing due ro running out of tc priority. [calico #9094](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9094) (@sridhartigera)
 - Fix Felix panicing when trying to resync a temporary IP set. Temporary IP sets are created in certain scenarios after previous failures. [calico #9078](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9078) (@fasaxc)
 - Helm: Fix error parsing kubernetesServiceEndpoint.host and kubernetesServiceEndpoint.port as an integer [calico #9068](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9068) (@MichalFupso)
