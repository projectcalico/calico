> This release includes a breaking change that moves the `kubeletVolumePath` configuration parameter to the installation section of the Helm chart values.yaml.

#### Streamline eBPF data plane installation

You can now easily install Calico with the eBPF data plane on most on-prem clusters (like those created using kubeadm), without manual configuration.
This new automated flow is enabled by setting parameters in the Installation API.

Previously, installing Calico with the eBPF data plane required a series of manual steps to manage kube-proxy and API service endpoints.
Now, the Tigera Operator handles all the necessary networking setup and kube-proxy disabling automatically, ensuring a seamless transition.

This new default behavior simplifies both fresh installations and switching an existing cluster's data plane from iptables to eBPF.
You can still use the manual setup process if needed.

#### nftables data plane GA

The nftables data plane is now generally available.

This enhancement leverages the Service implementation in Kubernetes 1.31 that uses nftables for network filtering, promising better performance and scalability compared to the default iptables implementation.
You can deploy Calico Open Source in nftables mode to provide a robust networking and network policy implementation that is fully compatible with the upstream kube-proxy utilizing nftables.

#### DSCP marking

This release enhances your Quality of Service (QoS) controls by enabling you to set Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) markings on your outgoing network traffic.
This capability is important for ensuring network prioritization for applications sensitive to latency or requiring differentiated treatment across a shared network.
You can now assign a DSCP value directly to packets originating from your Kubernetes pods and Calico host endpoints using the new `qos.projectcalico.org/dscp` annotation.
This approach moves the configuration of traffic priority from the network infrastructure layer to the application layer, giving you more reliable and enduring control.

#### Quality of Service (QoS) controls for eBPF data plane

We added support for QoS controls with eBPF.
If your cluster uses Calico's eBPF data plane, you can now use QoS controls for bandwidth limits, packet rate limits, and DSCP marking.

#### Full interface address coverage for auto host endpoints

You can now ensure that host endpoints automatically capture all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses across every network interface on your node.
This capability is essential for a robust and consistent security posture because it ensures that all IP addresses associated with a host are correctly mapped and protected by your network policies.
To manage which interfaces are included, you can use the new `interfacePattern` field in your `HostEndpointTemplate` within the `KubeControllersConfiguration`.

#### Fine-grained BGP control with per-peer local AS number

You can now configure a distinct local AS number for each external BGP peer by using the new `localASNumber` field in the `BGPPeer` resource.

This capability is essential for multi-homed topologies and environments where border nodes must peer with external networks, like government agencies, that require a specific local Autonomous System Number (ASN) different from the cluster's global or node-specific ASN configured in the `BGPConfiguration` resource.
This new field allows you to override the default ASN on a per-peer basis, removing the need to dedicate entire nodes to a single external peer.

If the `localASNumber` field is not set for a peer, Calico will automatically fall back to using the global or node-wide ASN as before, ensuring no change to your existing BGP behavior.

#### eBPF data plane: LRU connection tracking

You can now ensure superior service availability and performance under heavy network load with the introduction of the Least Recently Used (LRU) hash map for connection tracking (conntrack) in the eBPF data plane.

By switching to an LRU hash map, the conntrack system gains an intelligent, automatic eviction policy that removes the oldest, least recently used entries to make room for new connections, preventing network errors and dropped connections.

#### OpenStack: Immediate Neutron QoS policy application

Updates to OpenStack Neutron Quality of Service (QoS) policies are now applied immediately, minimizing configuration delays in large-scale environments.
Previously, policy changes relied on a slow, periodic resync process that could take a long time in large clusters.
With this enhancement, Calico responds to all QoS policy and rule changes on the Neutron API in real-time, enforcing network requirements within seconds and ensuring tenants have a consistent, reliable network experience.

[calico 10672](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10672) (@MichalFupso)
- Calico LoadBalancerController will consider service.spec.LoadBalancerClass in determining if IP should be assigned. When in RequestedServicesOnly mode service will be assigned IP if LoadBalancerClass is set to calico. When running in AllServices and RequestedServicesOnly mode and the LoadBalancerClass is set to other value than calico, service will not be assigned an IP [calico 10627](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10627) (@MichalFupso)

- Updated Calico to use quay.io as the default image registry, replacing docker.io. [calico 10025](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10025) (@skoryk-oleksandr)
- Performance: After failures to program IP sets, the dataplane now does a partial resync of only the affected IP sets. This should reduce the overhead of dealing with a transient failure. [calico 9674](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9674) (@fasaxc)
- New Felix config param natOutgoingExclusions allows for configuring which type of destinations is excluded from being masqueraded. [calico 8961](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8961) (@wayne-cheng)

- OpenStack: support IPv6 subnets using SLAAC [calico 11027](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11027) (@nelljerram)
- OpenStack QoS handling has been improved to respond immediately to all kinds of QoS changes on the Neutron API.  In particular when rules are added, updated or deleted for a QoS policy that is already in use, and when a QoS policy is added, updated or deleted for a Neutron network that is already in use.  Calico's handling of these changes previously relied on a periodic resync, which could in practice take a long time; now those changes are handled immediately (within a few seconds). [calico 10931](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10931) (@nelljerram)
- Calico for OpenStack's QoS support has been enhanced to cover packet rate burst size configuration.  There are new driver settings (cluster-wide, set in `neutron.conf`) for configuring max and min packet burst sizes in each direction. [calico 10521](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10521) (@nelljerram)
- Calico for OpenStack's QoS support has been enhanced to cover peak rate configuration.  The "max_burst_kbps" field of bandwidth limit rules is honoured as the peak rate, and there are new driver settings (cluster-wide, set in `neutron.conf`) for configuring max and min burst sizes in each direction. [calico 10500](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10500) (@nelljerram)
- Add Ubuntu 24.04 packages for OpenStack [calico 8685](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/8685) (@danudey)

- ebpf: Added a new Felix configuration option `CgroupV2Path` to set a custom cgroupV2 mount path, improving compatibility with immutable OSes like Talos Linux. [calico 10877](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10877) (@lucastigera)
- ebpf: faster interaction with BPF maps from userspace due to batching update and delete operations. Should specifically help on larger and more churny clusters. [calico 10802](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10802) (@tomastigera)
- Add support for packet rate QoS controls on the eBPF dataplane. [calico 10740](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10740) (@coutinhop)
- ebpf: conntrack cleanup now uses a hybrid approach with a scan being done from user space (to avoid disturbing LRU state) and then deletions being done from BPF program. [calico 10736](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10736) (@sridhartigera)
- The init container `mount-bpffs` is now named `ebpf-bootstrap` to reflect its broader responsibilities. No impact on functionality. [calico 10731](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10731) (@lucastigera)
- ebpf: on ingress to node use pre-dnat IP for icmp response. Either it is an external IP or routable from the previous hop. The node can pose as having the VIP. [calico 10671](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10671) (@tomastigera)
