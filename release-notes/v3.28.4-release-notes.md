#### Bug fixes

 - eBPF - Fixed a bug where BPF programs were being re-attached to network interfaces unnecessarily, even when the host IP address had not changed. [calico #10165](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10165) (@sridhartigera)

#### Other changes

 - Removed Kubernets PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) Support. PodSecurityPolicies were removed from Kubernetes v1.25+, and Calico no longer supports older versions. PSPs are no longer rendered on supported clusters. [calico #10196](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10196) (@lucastigera)
