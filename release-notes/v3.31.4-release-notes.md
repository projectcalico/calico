#### Bug fixes

- Fix race in EndpointSlice logic for BGP service advertisement [calico 11786](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11786) (@MichalFupso)
- Fix rendering of NatPortRange option when using nftables. [calico 11741](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11741) (@nelljerram)
- Don't uninstall CNI and kube-proxy service when using non-Calico CNI on Windows with operator install. [calico 11722](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11722) (@coutinhop)
- Fix that the CNI plugin installer generated a malformed URL for IPv4 addresses.  This bug was exposed by a fix to the golang URL parser. [calico 11719](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11719) (@fasaxc)
- Various fixes for 32bit architectures. [calico 11705](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11705) (@juanluisvaladas)
- ebpf: fix - The eBPF dataplane regressed when switching to the flow based vxlan device and the VNI is always 0 regardless of the actual setting [calico 11695](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11695) (@tomastigera)
- ebpf: fixed performance for UDP (QUIC/HTTP3) nodeports [calico 11659](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11659) (@tomastigera)
- eBPF: fix that local workload with borrowed IPs lose connectivity [calico 11654](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11654) (@fasaxc)
- ebpf: Do not adjust gso_size after nodeport tunnel vxlan decap. There is no guarantee that there would be enough data after removing tunnel headers. The packet is shrunk by 50 bytes while the gso_size would grow. Kernel would drop the packet if the original gso packet is too small. [calico 11613](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11613) (@tomastigera)
- OpenStack bugfix: request etcd compaction periodically regardless of how long resync takes, or if periodic resync is disabled. [calico 11575](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11575) (@nelljerram)
- bpf: Fix IP fragment reassembly between 8,000 and 16,000 bytes.  Offsets were miscalculated due to incorrect order of operations. [calico 11562](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11562) (@fasaxc)

#### Other changes

- We continue testing Calico against OpenStack Caracal, but have stopped testing Calico against OpenStack Yoga.  This is because Yoga has now been "unmaintained" for over a year, and is not compatible with current CI platforms based on Ubuntu 22.04. [calico 11745](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11745) (@nelljerram)
- Adds configurable field `resync_max_interval_secs` that defines the max time allowed between successful periodic resyncs. Logs an error message if the interval exceeds the threshold. [calico 11650](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11650) (@nelljerram)
