#### Bug fixes

- ebpf: fixed performance for UDP (QUIC/HTTP3) nodeports [calico 11659](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11659) (@tomastigera)
- ebpf: Do not adjust gso_size after nodeport tunnel vxlan decap. There is no guarantee that there would be enough data after removing tunnel headers. The packet is shrunk by 50 bytes while the gso_size would grow. Kernel would drop the packet if the original gso packet is too small. [calico 11613](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11613) (@tomastigera)
- OpenStack bugfix: request etcd compaction periodically regardless of how long resync takes, or if periodic resync is disabled. [calico 11575](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11575) (@nelljerram)
- bpf: Fix IP fragment reassembly between 8,000 and 16,000 bytes.  Offsets were miscalculated due to incorrect order of operations. [calico 11562](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11562) (@fasaxc)

#### Other changes

- Add configurable field `resync_max_interval_secs` that defines the max time allowed between successful periodic resyncs. Log an error message if the interval exceeds the threshold. [calico 11650](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/11650) (@nelljerram)
