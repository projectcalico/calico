> #### Tiered Policy naming changes
>
> If you are upgrading your Calico cluster to v3.30.1, please see [the release notes from Calico v3.29.4](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/v3.29.4/release-notes/v3.29.4-release-notes.md) as naming of policies in the default tier may have changed.
>
> Clusters meeting the following criteria may be affected:
>
> 1. You previously had Calico v3.29.1, v3.29.2, or v3.29.3 installed
> 2. You created rules in the default tier while those versions were installed
> 3. Your cluster has never been upgraded to v3.29.4 (even if you have upgraded to v3.30.0 already)
