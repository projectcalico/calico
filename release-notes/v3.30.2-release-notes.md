#### QoS Enhancements

##### Several enhancements have been made to Calico's QoS controls [calico 10518](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10518)

* Added support for peakrate (and optionally minburst) configuration to bandwidth QoS controls.
* Added support for packet burst configuration to packet rate QoS controls.
* Fixed upper and lower boundaries of packet rate and number of connections QoS controls to be in-line with kernel limits.

##### Several enhancements have been made to Calico's QoS support in OpenStack [calico 10532](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/10532) (@nelljerram)

* Calico for OpenStack's QoS support has been enhanced to cover packet rate burst size configuration.  There are new driver settings (cluster-wide, set in `neutron.conf`) for configuring max and min packet burst sizes in each direction.
* Calico for OpenStack's QoS support has been enhanced to cover peak rate configuration.  The `max_burst_kbps` field of bandwidth limit rules is honoured as the peak rate, and there are new driver settings (cluster-wide, set in `neutron.conf`) for configuring max and min burst sizes in each direction.
