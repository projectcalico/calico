title: Global Network Set Resource (GlobalNetworkSet)
---

A global network set resource (GlobalNetworkSet) represents an arbitrary set of IP subnetworks/CIDRs, 
allowing it to be matched by {{site.prodname}} policy.  Network sets are useful for applying policy to traffic
coming from (or going to) external, non-{{site.prodname}}, networks.

The metadata for each network set includes a set of labels.  When {{site.prodname}} is calculating the set of
IPs that should match a source/destination selector within a
[global network policy]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/resources/globalnetworkpolicy) rule, it includes
the CIDRs from any network sets that match the selector.

> **Important**: Since {{site.prodname}} matches packets based on their source/destination IP addresses, 
> {{site.prodname}} rules may not behave as expected if there is NAT between the {{site.prodname}}-enabled node and the
> networks listed in a network set.  For example, in Kubernetes, incoming traffic via a service IP is
> typically SNATed by the kube-proxy before reaching the destination host so {{site.prodname}}'s workload 
> policy will see the kube-proxy's host's IP as the source instead of the real source.

For `calicoctl` commands that specify a resource type on the CLI, the following
aliases are supported (all case insensitive): `globalnetworkset`, `globalnetworksets`.

### Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkSet
metadata:
  name: a-name-for-the-set
  labels:
    role: external-database
spec:
  nets:
  - 198.51.100.0/28
  - 203.0.113.0/24
```
