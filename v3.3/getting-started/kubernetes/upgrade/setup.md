## Requirements

A host with connectivity to the existing etcdv2 datastore as well as the
target etcdv3 cluster. The host must be AMD64 and running one of the following:

- OS X or macOS
- Linux
- Windows

{% include {{page.version}}/install-calico-upgrade.md %}

## Configuring calico-upgrade

### About configuring calico-upgrade

You must configure `calico-upgrade` so that it can connect to both of the
following:

- [The existing etcdv2 datastore used by Calico v2.6.5](#configuring-calico-upgrade-to-connect-to-the-etcdv2-datastore)

- [The etcdv3 cluster you plan to use for Calico v3.x](#configuring-calico-upgrade-to-connect-to-the-etcdv3-cluster)

{% include {{page.version}}/config-calico-upgrade-etcd.md %}

## Next steps

After configuring `calico-upgrade` to communicate with the existing etcdv2 instance
and the target etcdv3 cluster, continue to [Testing the data migration](/{{page.version}}/getting-started/kubernetes/upgrade/test).
