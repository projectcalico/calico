title: DevStack plugin for Calico
canonical_url: 'https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.2/getting-started/openstack/installation/devstack'
---

The networking-calico project provides a DevStack plugin.  The following
instructions explain how to set up a single or multiple node DevStack/{{site.prodname}}
system, and then how to see {{site.prodname}} connectivity in action.

> **Note**: networking-calico includes a 
> [shell script](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/networking-calico/tree/devstack/bootstrap.sh) 
> that implements the following setup instructions. You are welcome to use it, 
> but we recommend that you read the following description first anyway, and 
> briefly review the script's code, so that you will understand what the 
> script does.

Single (or first) node setup
----------------------------

To prepare a single node DevStack/{{site.prodname}} system, that is with all controller
and compute functions running on the same node:

1. Download DevStack as usual.

2. Add to your DevStack local.conf file:

       enable_plugin networking-calico https://git.openstack.org/openstack/networking-calico

3. Run ``stack.sh``

4. Create a shared, routed network with an IPv4 subnet:

       . openrc admin admin
       neutron net-create --shared --provider:network_type local calico
       neutron subnet-create --gateway 10.65.0.1 --enable-dhcp --ip-version 4 --name calico-v4 calico 10.65.0/24

5. Ensure that IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding are enabled:

       sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
       sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1



Multi-node setup
----------------

This plugin also supports additional compute-only nodes.  So, in the system as
a whole, there can then be:

- one node with both controller and compute function

- any number of additional nodes with just compute function.

The first node should be prepared as described above.  Then, for each
additional compute node:

- set and export the SERVICE_HOST environment variable, to the name of the
  controller node; for example:

      export SERVICE_HOST=calico-vm18

- follow the steps above, except for the network and subnet creations, to
  install and set up DevStack with {{site.prodname}} on that node.


Demonstrating {{site.prodname}} connectivity
---------------------------------

Then, to see {{site.prodname}} connectivity in action:

1. Launch instances attached to the 'calico' network.

2. Use ``ip route`` to observe per-instance routes created by the {{site.prodname}} agent.

3. Log into each instance (e.g. through Horizon console) and verify that it can
   ping the others.
