title: Creating policy for basic connectivity
canonical_url: 'https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.2/getting-started/bare-metal/policy/'

When a host endpoint is added, if there is no security policy for that
endpoint, {{site.prodname}} will default to denying traffic to/from that endpoint,
except for traffic that is allowed by the [failsafe rules](failsafe).

While the [failsafe rules](failsafe) provide protection against removing all
connectivity to a host:

-   They are overly broad in allowing inbound SSH on any interface and
    allowing traffic out to etcd's ports on any interface.
    
-   Depending on your network, they may not cover all the ports that are
    required; for example, your network may rely on allowing ICMP,
    or DHCP.

Therefore, we recommend creating a failsafe {{site.prodname}} security policy that
is tailored to your environment. The example command below shows one
example of how you might do that; the command uses `calicoctl` to create a single 
policy resource, which:

  - Applies to all known endpoints.
  - Allows inbound ssh access from a defined "management" subnet.
  - Allows outbound connectivity to etcd on a particular IP; if
    you have multiple etcd servers you should duplicate the rule
    for each destination.
  - Allows inbound ICMP.
  - Allows outbound UDP on port 67, for DHCP.

When running this command, replace the placeholders in angle brackets with
appropriate values for your deployment.

```
cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
- apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
  kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: failsafe
  spec:
    selector: "all()"
    order: 0
    ingress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      source:
        nets:
        - "<your management CIDR>"
      destination:
        ports: [22]
    - action: Allow
      protocol: ICMP
    egress:
    - action: Allow
      protocol: TCP
      destination:
        nets:
        - "<your etcd IP>/32"
        ports: [<your etcd ports>]
    - action: Allow
      protocol: UDP
      destination:
        ports: [67]
EOF
```

Once you have such a policy in place, you may want to disable the
[failsafe rules](failsafe).

> If you are using {{site.prodname}} for networking workloads, you should add

> to allow TCP traffic to destination port 179.
