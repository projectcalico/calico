# Examples

This directory contains the following manifest file for deploying the 
Calico policy controller.  

This manifest is expected to work for most cases, but is not necessarily intended to be a "one size fits all" solution.

- `policy-controller.yaml`: A ReplicaSet which deploys the policy controller on top of Kubernetes.
