  # This promotion is only _automatic_ for the master branch.  For other
  # branches, and PRs, it is available but not automatic.  This means a
  # developer can trigger the building and publishing of release branch and
  # pre-merge packages by clicking the "Publish openstack packages" button in
  # the Semaphore UI.  When building from the master branch, packages are
  # published to the "master" PPA.  When building from any other branch,
  # packages are published to the "testing" PPA.  When building from a PR,
  # packages are published to the "pr-${SEMAPHORE_GIT_PR_NUMBER}" PPA, and that
  # PPA must have been created manually first.  PRs requiring packaging must
  # use a branch on github.com/projectcalico/calico, instead of on a fork repo,
  # because packaging requires secrets that we do not (and should not!) expose
  # to fork PRs.
