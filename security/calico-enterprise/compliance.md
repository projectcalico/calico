Calico policies can be used to implement security controls required by your security team. Some security controls are simple, such as separating development and test workloads or segmenting a cluster into security zones (DMZ, Trusted, etc.) or could be more complex like implementing HIPAA or PCI-DSS controls.

For most security teams, setting up and enforcing Calico Policy is not sufficient to meet their needs.
Security teams need additional controls to ensure their policies have precedence and are evaluated first before other policies.
They need to see proof that the controls are in place, being enforced, and working as expected (logs, evidence reports, audit history).

Calico Enterprise adds several features that satisfy the security teamâ€™s requirements.

### Tiered policies

- Enable separation of duties
- Define cluster-wide policies that cannot be overridden 
- Tiers are evaluated left to right, top to bottom
