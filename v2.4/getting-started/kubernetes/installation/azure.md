There are a number of solutions for deploying Calico and Kubernetes on Azure.  We recommend taking
a look at the following solutions and guides which install Calico for network policy on Azure.

#### Popular guides and tools

**[ACS Engine][acs-engine]** configures and deploys Kubernetes clusters on Azure with an option to enable Calico policy.

#### More installation options

If the out-of-the-box solutions listed above don't meet your requirements, you can install Calico for Kubernetes
on Azure using one of our [self-hosted manifests][self-hosted], or by [integrating Calico with your own configuration management][integration-guide].
