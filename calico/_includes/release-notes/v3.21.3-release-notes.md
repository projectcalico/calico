#### Bug fixes

 - Fix a serious regression introduced in v3.21.0 where the datastore watcher could get stuck and report stale information in clusters with >500 policies/pods/etc.  The bug was triggered by needing to do a resync (for example after an etcd compaction) when there were enough resources to trigger the list pager.
