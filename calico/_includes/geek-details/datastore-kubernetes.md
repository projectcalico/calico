{{site.prodname}} stores the operational and configuration state of your cluster in a central datastore. If the datastore is unavailable, your {{site.prodname}} network continues operating, but cannot be updated (no new pods can be networked, no policy changes can be applied, etc.).

{{site.prodname}} has two datastore drivers you can choose from
- etcd - for direct connection to an etcd cluster
- Kubernetes - for connection to a Kubernetes API server

The advantages of using Kubernetes as the datastore are:
- It doesn't require an extra datastore, so is simpler to install and manage
- You can use Kubernetes RBAC to control access to {{site.prodname}} resources
- You can use Kubernetes audit logging to generate audit logs of changes to {{site.prodname}} resources

For completeness, the advantages of using etcd as the datastore are:
- Allows you to run {{site.prodname}} on non-Kubernetes platforms (e.g. OpenStack)
- Allows separation of concerns between Kubernetes and {{site.prodname}} resources, for example allowing you to scale the datastores independently
- Allows you to run a {{site.prodname}} cluster that contains more than just a single Kubernetes cluster, for example, bare metal servers with {{site.prodname}} host protection interworking with a Kubernetes cluster or multiple Kubernetes clusters.
