# Calico
<img src="http://docs.projectcalico.org/images/felix.png" width="100" height="100">

Calico is an open source networking and network security solution for containers, virtual machines, and bare-metal workloads.
Calico uses standard Linux networking tools to provide two major services for Cloud Native applications:

- Network connectivity between workloads.
- Network security policy enforcement between workloads.

Calicoâ€™s flexible architecture supports a wide range of deployment options, using modular components, including:

- [CNI](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin) plugins for Kubernetes to provide highly efficient pod networking and IP
  Address Management (IPAM).
- A [Neutron ML2](https://github.com/projectcalico/networking-calico) plugin to provide VM networking for OpenStack.
- A policy engine, [Felix](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix), to provide enforcement of the full set of Kubernetes
  network policy features, plus for those needing a richer set of policy features, Calico network policies.
- Both non-overlay and [overlay (via IPIP or VXLAN)](https://docs.projectcalico.org/networking/vxlan-ipip) networking options
  in either public cloud or on-prem deployments.
- A [BGP routing stack](https://docs.projectcalico.org/networking/bgp) that can advertise routes for workload and service IP
  addresses to physical network infrastructure such as Top of Rack routers (ToRs).
- A simple command line interface, [calicoctl](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl), for managing Calico configuration
and Calico network policies.
