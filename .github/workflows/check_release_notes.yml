# This workflow will perform the following checks:
# 1. Check the PR for a specific label (by default 'release-note-required'); if it's not there, exit
# 2. Check the PR body for a matching release-note code block; if missing, fail
# 3. Check the contents of the code block to ensure it's not empty or 'TBD'; otherwise, fail
# 4. Success!
