# BGP Peer Resource
A BGP Peer resource represents a BGP peer which node(s) in this cluster will connect to. Configuration of BGP peers is required when configuring Calico to peer with your existing datacenter infrastructure (e.g. ToR). For more information on cluster layouts, see Calico's documentation on [L3 Topologies](http://docs.projectcalico.org/en/latest/l3-interconnectFabric.html).

There are two types of BGP Peers.

#### Global Peer
If this is a `global` scoped BGP peer, all nodes in the cluster will attempt to establish a BGP connection with it.

#### Node Peer
A BGP peer can also be added at the `node` scope, meaning only a single specified node will peer with it. BGP peer resources of this nature must specify a `hostname` to inform Calico which Node this peer is targeting.


### Sample YAML
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: bgppeer
metadata:
  scope: node
  hostname: rack1-host1
  peerIP: 192.168.1.1
spec:
  asNumber: 63400
```
