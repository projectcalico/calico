title: 'What is Calico?'
---

Calico is a new approach to virtual networking, based on the same
scalable IP networking principles as the Internet. It targets data
centers where most of the workloads (VMs, containers or bare metal
servers) only require IP connectivity, and provides that using standard
IP routing. Isolation between workloads - whether according to tenant
ownership, or any finer grained policy - is achieved by iptables
programming at the servers hosting the source and destination workloads.

In comparison with the common solutions that provide simulated layer 2
networks, Calico is a lot simpler, specifically in the following ways.

-   Packets flowing through a Calico network do not require additional
    encapsulation and decapsulation anywhere. In contrast, layer 2
    solutions typically require packets to be encapsulated in a
    tunneling protocol when travelling between host servers.
-   Where permitted by policy, Calico packets can be routed between
    different tenants' workloads, or out to or in from the Internet, in
    exactly the same way as between the workloads of a single tenant.
    There is no need for on-and off-ramps as in overlay solutions, and
    hence for passing through special 'networking' or 'router' nodes
    that provide those ramps.
-   As a consequence of those two points, Calico networks are easier to
    understand and to troubleshoot. Standard tools like ping and
    traceroute work for probing connectivity, and tcpdump and Wireshark
    for looking at flows -because Calico packets are just IP packets,
    and the same throughout the network.
-   Security policy is specified (using ACLs) and implemented (iptables)
    in a single uniform way - making it more likely that it will
    actually be correct and robust. In contrast, in layer 2 solutions,
    effective security policy is a more complex (but also
    less expressive) product of the networks and security groups that
    are defined for each tenant, and of any virtual 'routers' that have
    been defined to allow passage between tenant networks.
