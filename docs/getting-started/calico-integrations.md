To get started using Calico, we recommend running through one or more of the
available tutorials linked below.

These tutorials will help you understand the different environment options when
using Calico.  In most cases we provide worked examples using manual setup on
your own servers, a quick set-up in a virtualized environment using Vagrant and
a number of cloud services.
