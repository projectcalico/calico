title: Demonstrating Calico Policy
---
# Pre-requisites
The included demo sets up a frontend and backend service, as well as a client service, all
running on Kubernetes.  It then configures network policy on each service. 

To create a Kubernetes cluster which supports the Kubernetes v1alpha1 network policy API, follow our [Vagrant CoreOS guide](../VagrantCoreOS).  
This guide includes the [files necessary for this example](.).

# Running the stars example 
1) Log on to your Kubernetes master.

```shell
vagrant ssh k8s-master
```

2) Download and configure the [policy tool](https://github.com/projectcalico/k8s-policy/blob/master/policy_tool/index) for NetworkPolicy management.

```shell
# Install the tool.
wget https://github.com/projectcalico/k8s-policy/releases/download/v0.1.3/policy
chmod +x ./policy
sudo mv ./policy /opt/bin

# Ensure the tool can access the API. This command will display an
# error if the API is not reachable.
policy list
```

3) Create the `frontend`, `backend`, `client`, and `management-ui` ReplicationControllers and Services.

```shell
kubectl create -f stars-demo/manifests/ 
```

Wait for all the pods to enter `Running` state.

```shell
watch kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

> Note that it may take several minutes to download the necessary Docker images for this demo.

The management UI runs as a `NodePort` Service on Kubernetes, and shows the connectivity
of the Services in this example.

You can view the UI by visiting `http://172.18.18.102:30002` in a browser.

Once all the pods are started, they should have full connectivity. You can see this by visiting the UI.  Each service is represented by a single node in the graph.

- `backend` -> Node "B"
- `frontend` -> Node "F"
- `client` -> Node "C" 

4) Enable isolation

```shell
kubectl annotate ns stars "net.alpha.kubernetes.io/network-isolation=yes" --overwrite=true
kubectl annotate ns client "net.alpha.kubernetes.io/network-isolation=yes" --overwrite=true
```

This will prevent all access to the frontend, backend, and client Services.

Refresh the management UI (it may take up to 10 seconds for changes to be reflected in the UI).  
Now that we've enabled isolation, the UI can no longer access the pods, and so they will no longer show up in the UI.  

Allow the UI to access the Services using NetworkPolicy objects.

```shell
# Allow access from the management UI. 
policy create -f stars-demo/policies/allow-ui.yaml
policy create -f stars-demo/policies/allow-ui-client.yaml
```

After a few seconds, refresh the UI - it should now show the Services, but they should not be able to access each other any more.

5) Create the "backend-policy.yaml" file to allow traffic from the frontend to the backend.

```shell
policy create -f stars-demo/policies/backend-policy.yaml
```

Refresh the UI.  You should see the following:

- The frontend can now access the backend (on TCP port 80 only).
- The backend cannot access the frontend at all.
- The client cannot access the frontend, nor can it access the backend.

6) Expose the frontend service to the `client` namespace.

```shell
policy create -f stars-demo/policies/frontend-policy.yaml
```

The client can now access the frontend, but not the backend.  Neither the frontend nor the backend can initiate connections to the client.  The frontend can still access the backend.
