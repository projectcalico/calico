Introduction
============

This project contains documentation and code for integrating Project Calico's
networking into OpenStack/Neutron.

Calico is an open source solution for virtual networking in cloud data centers,
developed principally by Metaswitch Networks and released under the Apache 2.0
License.

For general documentation about Calico, please see
http://docs.projectcalico.org.  This includes how to get started with Calico on
OpenStack, as well as on other cloud platforms, and information about how
Calico works that is independent of any particular platform.

For documentation about Calico for readers who are already familiar with
OpenStack, and interested specifically in the networking-calico driver, please
see http://docs.openstack.org/developer/networking-calico.
