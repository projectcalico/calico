To get started using {{site.prodname}}, we recommend running through one or more of the
available tutorials linked below.

These tutorials will help you understand the different environment options when

your own servers, a quick set-up in a virtualized environment using Vagrant and
a number of cloud services.

- [{{site.prodname}} with Kubernetes](kubernetes)
- [{{site.prodname}} with OpenShift](openshift/installation)
- [{{site.prodname}} with OpenStack](openstack)
