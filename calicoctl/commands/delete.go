Examples:
  # Delete a policy using the type and name specified in policy.yaml.
  calicoctl delete -f ./policy.yaml

  # Delete a policy based on the type and name in the YAML passed into stdin.
  cat policy.yaml | calicoctl delete -f -

  # Delete policy with name "foo"
  calicoctl delete policy foo

Options:
  -h --help                 Show this screen.
  -s --skip-not-exists      Skip over and treat as successful, resources that
                            don't exist.
  -f --filename=<FILENAME>  Filename to use to delete the resource.  If set to
                            "-" loads from stdin.
  -c --config=<CONFIG>      Path to the file containing connection
                            configuration in YAML or JSON format.
                            [default: ` + constants.DefaultConfigPath + `]
  -n --namespace=<NS>       Namespace of the resource.
                            Only applicable to NetworkPolicy and WorkloadEndpoint.
                            Only applicable to NetworkPolicy, NetworkSet, and WorkloadEndpoint.
                            Uses the default namespace if not specified.

Description:
  The delete command is used to delete a set of resources by filename or stdin,
  or by type and identifiers.  JSON and YAML formats are accepted for file and
  stdin format.

  Valid resource types are:

    * bgpConfiguration
    * bgpPeer
    * felixConfiguration
    * globalNetworkPolicy
    * globalNetworkSet
    * hostEndpoint
    * ipPool
    * networkPolicy
    * networkSet
    * node
    * profile
    * workloadEndpoint

  The resource type is case insensitive and may be pluralized.

  Attempting to delete a resource that does not exists is treated as a
  terminating error unless the --skip-not-exists flag is set.  If this flag is
  set, resources that do not exist are skipped.

  When deleting resources by type, only a single type may be specified at a
  time.  The name is required along with any and other identifiers required to
  uniquely identify a resource of the specified type.

  The output of the command indicates how many resources were successfully
  deleted, and the error reason if an error occurred.  If the --skip-not-exists
  flag is set then skipped resources are included in the success count.

  The resources are deleted in the order they are specified.  In the event of a
  failure deleting a specific resource it is possible to work out which
  resource failed based on the number of resources successfully deleted.
