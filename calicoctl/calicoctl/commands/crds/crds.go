Note:\n                  \\tWhen using the selector match criteria in an ingress or egress\n                  security Policy \\tor Profile, Calico converts the selector into\n                  a set of IP addresses. For host \\tendpoints, the ExpectedIPs field\n                  is used for that purpose. (If only the interface \\tname is specified,\n                  Calico does not learn the IPs of the interface for use in match\n                  \\tcriteria.)\"\n                items:\n                  type: string\n                type: array\n              interfaceName:\n                description: \"Either \\\"*\\\", or the name of a specific Linux interface\n                  to apply policy to; or empty.  \\\"*\\\" indicates that this HostEndpoint\n                  governs all traffic to, from or through the default network namespace\n                  of the host named by the \\\"Node\\\" field; entering and leaving that\n                  namespace via any interface, including those from/to non-host-networked\n                  local workloads. \\n If InterfaceName is not \\\"*\\\", this HostEndpoint\n                  only governs traffic that enters or leaves the host through the\n                  specific interface named by InterfaceName, or - when InterfaceName\n                  is empty - through the specific interface that has one of the IPs\n                  in ExpectedIPs.
