networking-calico (1:1.3.1-xenial) xenial; urgency=low

  * networking-calico release (from Git commit f93201f).
    - Allow Calico with OpenStack to coexist with other orchestrators using Calico.
    - Import utility code from core Calico repo, so that networking-calico becomes
      independent of that repo.
    - Fix Neutron driver to correctly handle etcd connection being temporarily
      stopped or unavailable.
