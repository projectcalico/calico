# Some commands that would typically be run at container build time must be run in a privileged container.
# Therefore, we do a two step image build process, in step 1 (now) scripts are placed in the image, in step 2
# a privileged container is started and the scripts are executed.

# rpmbuild requires the current user to exist inside the container, copy in
# some user/group entries calculated by the makefile.
# use `--force` and `-o` since tests can run under root and command will fail with duplicate error
