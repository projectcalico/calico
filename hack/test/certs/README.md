# FV certificates

The files in this directory are used only in the FV tests in this repository, and were generated according to the steps in [Kubernetes the hard
way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).

To regenerate them, run ./regenerate.sh.  This completely deletes and recreates all the keys and certificates, including the root CA.
