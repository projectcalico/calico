# This script runs Openshift preflight against Calico images and optionally uploads the results to Openshift Connect for the certification process.
# In addition, the certification process also requires the following, which are NOT handled by this script:
# - the operator metadata bundle (see the tigera/operator repo) to be submitted by PR
#   to https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators
# - running the Openshift End-to-End tests - we run them for CNI and CNV.  The results need to be passed to the Certification team for verification.
