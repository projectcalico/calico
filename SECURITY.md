# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Tigera team generally support the most recent two minor versions
of Project Calico on a rolling basis.  Support for older versions is on a 
case-by-case basis.  For example, at the time of writing, 
Calico v3.26.x and v3.25.x are supported.  When v3.27.0 is released,
automatic support for v3.25.x is dropped.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please follow responsible disclosure best practices and [Tigera's Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.tigera.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) when submitting
security vulnerabilities.  **Do not** create a Github issue or pull 
request because those are immediately public. Instead:

*  Email psirt@tigera.io.
*  Report a private [security advisory](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/security/advisories)
  through the Github interface.

Please include as much information as possible, including the
affected version(s) and steps to reproduce.
