The command line tool, `calicoctl`, makes it easy to manage {{site.prodname}} network and security policy, as well as other
{{site.prodname}} configurations.  

The calicoctl command line interface provides a number of resource management
commands to allow you to create, modify, delete, and view the different {{site.prodname}}
resources.

The full list of commands is described in the
[Command reference]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/commands/)
section.

The full list of resources that can be managed, including a description of each,
