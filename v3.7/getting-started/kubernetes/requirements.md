## Kubernetes requirements

#### Supported versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following Kubernetes versions.

- 1.12
- 1.13
- 1.14

Other versions are likely to work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}}
{{page.version}} against them.

Application Layer Policy requires Kubernetes 1.9 or later.

#### CNI plug-in enabled

{{site.prodname}} is installed as a CNI plugin. The kubelet must be configured
to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument. (On
kubeadm, this is the default.)

#### Other network providers

{{site.prodname}} must be the only network provider in each cluster. We do
not currently support migrating a cluster with another network provider to
use {{site.prodname}} networking.

#### Supported kube-proxy modes

{{site.prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:
- `iptables` (default)
- `ipvs` Requires Kubernetes >=v1.9.3. Refer to
  [Enabling IPVS in Kubernetes](../../networking/enabling-ipvs) for more details.

#### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated

## Application layer policy requirements

- [MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook) enabled
- [Istio v1.0](https://istio.io/about/notes/1.0/)
