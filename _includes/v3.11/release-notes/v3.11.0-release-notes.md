#### Support dual-stack pod IPs

Native support for both IPv4 and IPv6 is known as "dual stack" and Kubernetes has alpha-level support for this in versions 1.16 and 1.17.
With this v3.11 release, Calico now supports the new Kubernetes APIs for dual stack. This allows you to use both IPv4 and IPv6 for your cluster pods. For more information on enabling
dual stack, please see the howto [documentation](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.11/networking/dual-stack).
