#### Support dual-stack pod IPs

Native support for both IPv4 and IPv6 is known as "dual stack" and Kubernetes has alpha-level support for this in versions 1.16 and 1.17.
With this v3.11 release, Calico now supports the new Kubernetes APIs for dual stack. This allows you to use both IPv4 and IPv6 for your cluster pods. For more information on enabling
dual stack, please see the howto [documentation](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.11/networking/dual-stack).

#### Calico for OpenStack enhancements

Calico for OpenStack now supports etcd authentication with etcd v3.3.11 and later. We previously supported etcd authentication with the user name being specified by a TLS client certificate,
but that was realized to be insecure, and etcd authentication with HTTP/JSON now requires a different approach, for which we have added support in this release.

We've also added more detailed logging in various scenarios where Calico for OpenStack components see errors in working with the etcd cluster.
