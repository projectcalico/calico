#### Bug fixes

 - When interpreting Kubernetes NetworkPolicy ports, Calico now interprets an empty port struct as "all TCP" as per the NetworkPolicy spec.  Previously, empty structs were ignored. [libcalico-go #1371](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1371) (@mgleung)

- Includes changes for [typha #484](https://github.com/projectcalico/typha/pull/484) (@fasaxc) targeted for Calico v3.16.8 that were excluded due to build issues.
