#### Bug fixes

- Fix a bug with mismatched node names when migrating IPAM data from etcd to Kubernetes datastores. [calicoctl #2196](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/pull/2196) (@mgleung)
- Fix that broadcast routes weren't filtered out of felix's list of local IPs.  In BPF mode, this caused dataplane route flaps. [felix #2496](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2496) (@fasaxc)
