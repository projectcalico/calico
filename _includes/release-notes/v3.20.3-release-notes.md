#### Bug fixes

 - Fixes this [bug](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/5018) which caused WireGuard stats to be collected even when WireGuard was disabled. Additionally, the version of the wgctrl dependency has been updated as the previous version caused thread leaks. [felix #3058](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/3058) (@mikestephen)
 - Fix potential panic and memory leak in kube-controllers caused by adding and subsequently deleting IPAM blocks [kube-controllers #913](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/913) (@caseydavenport)
 - IPAM GC correctly handles multiple IP addresses allocated with the same handle ID. [kube-controllers #904](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/904) (@caseydavenport)
