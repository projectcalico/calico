#### Bug fixes

 - Fix slow performance when updating a Kubernetes namespace when there are many Pods (and in turn, slow startup performance when there are many namespaces). [felix #2969](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2969) (@fasaxc)
 - Fix that podIP annotation could be incorrectly clobbered for stateful set pods: https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/4710 [libcalico-go #1483](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1483) (@fasaxc)
 - Reinstates logic that falls back to the status of the pod during termination if the pod IP annotation is not set by the Calico CNI plugin. [libcalico-go #1449](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1449) (@song-jiang)
 - Fix concurrent map access panic in confd [confd #541](https://github.com/projectcalico/confd/pull/541) (@rene-dekker)
