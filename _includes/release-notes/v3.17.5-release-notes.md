#### Bug fixes

 - Fix slow performance when updating a Kubernetes namespace when there are many Pods (and in turn, slow startup performance when there are many namespaces). [felix #2970](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2970) (@fasaxc)
 - Reinstates logic that falls back to the status of the pod during termination if the pod IP annotation is not set by the Calico CNI plugin. [libcalico-go #1450](https://github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/pull/1450) (@song-jiang)
