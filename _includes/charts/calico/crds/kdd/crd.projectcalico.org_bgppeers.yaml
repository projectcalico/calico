                  and this peer IP and ASNumber belongs to a calico/node with ListenPort

                  an IPv4 peering if both ends have NodeBGPSpec.IPv4Address specified,
                  and an IPv6 peering if both ends have NodeBGPSpec.IPv6Address specified.  The
                  remote AS number comes from the remote node’s NodeBGPSpec.ASNumber,
                  or the global default if that is not set.
