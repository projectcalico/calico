        description: ImageSet is used to specify image digests for the images that
          the operator deploys. The name of the ImageSet is expected to be in the
          format `<variang>-<release>`. The `variant` used is `enterprise` if the
          InstallationSpec Variant is `TigeraSecureEnterprise` otherwise it is `calico`.
          The `release` must match the version of the variant that the operator is
          built to deploy, this version can be obtained by passing the `--version`
          flag to the operator binary.
