                  used when this field is not set, or is set to "PreferExisting" - is that the Tigera
                  operator will create the Gateway API CRDs if they do not already exist, but will not
                  overwrite any existing Gateway API CRDs.  This setting may be preferable if the customer
                  is using other implementations of the Gateway API concurrently with the Gateway API
                  support in Calico Enterprise.  It is then the customer's responsibility to ensure that
                  CRDs are installed that meet the needs of all the Gateway API implementations in their
                  cluster.
                  Alternatively, if this field is set to "Reconcile", the Tigera operator will keep the
                  cluster's Gateway API CRDs aligned with those that it would install on a cluster that
                  does not yet have any version of those CRDs.

                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                                This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                                This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        has a toleration, are included.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                        And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                        WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                        the spread constraint.
                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.
