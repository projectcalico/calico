                                                    be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                    incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                    to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                    for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                    pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                    The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                    Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                                    This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                          The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                          can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                          This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                          Default value is 0.
                          Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                          that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                          can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                          The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                          pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                          on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                          reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                          pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                          Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                          daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                          so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                          cause evictions during disruption.

                          can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                          starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                          up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.
                                        This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                                        Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                              The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                              can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                              Default value is 0.
                              Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                              that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                              can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                              pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                              on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                              reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                              pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                              Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                              daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                              so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                              cause evictions during disruption.

                              can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                              starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                              up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                              it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                              70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                              the update.

                                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                            to topologies that satisfy it.

                                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                            it will violate MaxSkew.
                                            This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
