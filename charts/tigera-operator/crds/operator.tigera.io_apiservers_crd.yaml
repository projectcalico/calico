                                        is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule
                                        more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If
                                        value is nil, the constraint behaves as if
                                        MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are
                                        integers greater than 0. When value is not
                                        nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                                        \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew
                                        is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods
                                        with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        \ P P  | The number of domains is less than
                                        5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                                        as 0. In this situation, new pod with the
                                        same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because
                                        computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod
                                        is scheduled to any of the three zones, it
                                        will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field
                                        and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread
                                        feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default)."

                                        incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
