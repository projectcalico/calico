# imagePullSecrets is a special helm field which, when specified, creates a secret
# containing the pull secret which is used to pull all images deployed by this helm chart and the resulting operator.
# this field is a map where the key is the desired secret name and the value is the contents of the imagePullSecret.
#
# Example: --set-file imagePullSecrets.gcr=./pull-secret.json
imagePullSecrets: {}

  enabled: true
  kubernetesProvider: ""
  # imagePullSecrets are configured on all images deployed by the tigera-operator.
  # secrets specified here must exist in the tigera-operator namespace; they won't be created by the operator or helm.
  # imagePullSecrets are a slice of LocalObjectReferences, which is the same format they appear as on deployments.
  #
  # Example: --set installation.imagePullSecrets[0].name=my-existing-secret
  imagePullSecrets: []
