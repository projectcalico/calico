There are many ways to try out {{site.prodname}} with OpenStack.  We provide instructions for the
following methods:

- [Package-based install for Ubuntu]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/openstack/installation/ubuntu)

- [RPM-based install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/openstack/installation/redhat)

- [DevStack]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/openstack/installation/devstack) (for development purposes only—not recommended for production!)

In all cases, except DevStack, you will need at least two or three servers to
get going: one OpenStack controller and one or more OpenStack compute nodes.
