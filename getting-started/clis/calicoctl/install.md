### Big picture

This guide helps you install the `calicoctl` command line tool to manage {{site.prodname}} resources 
and perform administrative functions.

### Value 

The `calicoctl` command line tool is required in order to use many of {{site.prodname}}'s features. It 
is used to manage {{site.prodname}} policies and configuration, as well as view detailed cluster status.

### Concepts

#### API groups

All Kubernetes resources belong to an API group. The API group is indicated by the resource's `apiVersion`. For example, {{site.prodname}}
uses resources in the `projectcalico.org/v3` API group for configuration, and the operator uses resources in the `operator.tigera.io/v1` API group.

You can read more about API groups in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-groups).

#### calicoctl and kubectl

In order to manage {{site.prodname}} APIs in the `projectcalico.org/v3` API group, you should use `calicoctl`. This is because
`calicoctl` provides important validation and defaulting for these resources that is not available in `kubectl`. However, `kubectl`
should still be used to manage other Kubernetes resources.

> **Note**: If you would like to use `kubectl` to manage `projectcalico.org/v3` API resources, you can try the 
>           [Calico API server tech-preview]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/kubernetes/apiserver-preview).
{: .alert .alert-info}

> **Warning**: Never modify resources in the `crd.projectcalico.org` API group directly. These are internal data representations 
>              and modifying them directly may result in unexpected behavior.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

In addition to resource management, `calicoctl` also enables other {{site.prodname}} administrative tasks such as viewing IP pool utilization
and BGP status.

#### Datastore

{{site.prodname}} objects are stored in one of two datastores, either etcd or Kubernetes. The choice of datastore is determined at the time {{site.prodname}}
is installed. Typically for Kubernetes installations the Kubernetes datastore is the default.

You can run `calicoctl` on any host with network access to the {{site.prodname}} datastore as either a binary or a container.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to the section that corresponds to your desired deployment.

<!--- Change download URL to latest release if user browsing master branch.  --->
{%- if page.version == "master" -%}
{% assign version = "latest/download" %}
{% else %}
{% assign version = "download/" | append: site.data.versions.first.components.calicoctl.version %}
{% endif %}

### How to

> **Note**: Make sure you always install the version of `calicoctl` that matches the version of {{site.prodname}} running on your cluster.

#### Install calicoctl as a container on a single host

To install `calicoctl` as a container on a single host, log into the
target host and issue the following command.

```bash
docker pull {{page.registry}}{{page.imageNames["calicoctl"]}}:{{site.data.versions.first.title}}
```

#### Install calicoctl as a Kubernetes pod


Use the YAML that matches your datastore type to deploy the `calicoctl` container to your nodes.

- **etcd**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f {{ "/manifests/calicoctl-etcd.yaml" | absolute_url }}
  ```

  > **Note**: You can also
  > [view the YAML in a new tab]({{ "/manifests/calicoctl-etcd.yaml" | absolute_url }}){:target="_blank"}.
  {: .alert .alert-info}

- **Kubernetes API datastore**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f {{ "/manifests/calicoctl.yaml" | absolute_url }}
  ```

  > **Note**: You can also
  > [view the YAML in a new tab]({{ "/manifests/calicoctl.yaml" | absolute_url }}){:target="_blank"}.
  {: .alert .alert-info}

You can then run commands using kubectl as shown below.

```bash
kubectl exec -ti -n kube-system calicoctl -- /calicoctl get profiles -o wide
```

An example response follows.

```
NAME                 TAGS
kns.default          kns.default
kns.kube-system      kns.kube-system
```
{: .no-select-button}

We recommend setting an alias as follows.

```bash
alias calicoctl="kubectl exec -i -n kube-system calicoctl -- /calicoctl"
```

   > **Note**: In order to use the `calicoctl` alias
   > when reading manifests, redirect the file into stdin, for example:
   > ```bash
   > calicoctl create -f - < my_manifest.yaml
   > ```
   {: .alert .alert-info}

**Next step**:

[Configure `calicoctl` to connect to your datastore](configure).
