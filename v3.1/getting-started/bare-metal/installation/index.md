  and CentOS hosts, use the package manager to install and run Felix as a binary.
  
- [Binary without package manager](binary): On CoreOS and Debian hosts, you can
  install Felix without a package manager.
  
- [Container](container): On hosts equipped with Docker, you can install `{{site.nodecontainer}}`,
  which contains Felix and all of its dependencies.
