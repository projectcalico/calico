There are a number of solutions for deploying {{site.prodname}} and Kubernetes on GCE.  We recommend taking
a look at the following solutions and guides which install {{site.prodname}} for networking and network policy on GCE.

Make sure you've read the [GCE configuration guide](../../../reference/public-cloud/gce) for details on how to configure {{site.prodname}} and GCE.
