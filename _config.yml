# Note: The version_fix variable below is used to reference
# versioned site data. Liquid has a bug where it truncates after the first `.` 
# of a directory name in _data (i.e. _data/v0.1 will be stored as data.v0). 
# https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5429
# Until that bugfix is included in the next github pages gem revision,
# we store version data in _data/v0_1 and do a string replace,
# and reference the data via site.data[version_fix].
