# Calico documentation style guide


## Overview

We follow [_The Chicago Manual of Style_, 17th Edition](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org/), the [_Yahoo! Style Guide_](https://www.amazon.com/Yahoo-Style-Guide-Ultimate-Sourcebook/dp/031256984X), and the [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

This style guide contains:

- Deviations from and extensions to the primary style resources
- Clarification on frequent points of confusion
- Terminology guidelines


## Voice

The passive voice can obscure the actor and result in weak sentences. 
In general, we prefer the active voice. For more information on this 
topic, consult the following resources:

- [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/539/02/)
- [Grammar Girl](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/active-voice-versus-passive-voice)


## Pronouns

Use the second person to refer to your reader. 

- **Correct**: "You must migrate your data before upgrading." 
- **Incorrect**: "We need to migrate our data before upgrading."

Use the first person plural to refer to Project Calico.

- **Correct**: "We recommend five nodes."
- **Incorrect**: "Five nodes are recommended." 


## Anthropomorphism

Avoid personifying software. 

**Correct**:
- "Kubernetes detects that Calico is installed."
- "The delimiter specifies where to split the string."

**Incorrect**:
- "Kubernetes sees that Calico is installed."
- "The delimiter tells Calico where to split the string."


## Future features

Avoid documenting future features or products.


## Graphics

### Screenshots and animated GIFs

We discourage including screenshots and animated GIFs of web interfaces. 
Such graphics are difficult to maintain, take up a lot of real estate, 
and often add negligible value. 

### Bitmap formats

When including a static screenshot image, use the PNG format. For animated
sequences, use GIF.

### Vector formats

For diagrams and other vector illustrations, we prefer the SVG format.


## Format of source

### HTML versus Markdown

We prefer Markdown for readability. 

### Line wraps

Wrap lines at 80 charactersâ€”except [URLs](#line-breaks).


## Punctuation

### Commas

Use [serial (aka Oxford) commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). 

### Hyphens

Use hyphens only when necessary to prevent confusion. Examples include:
- A prefix ends in the same vowel that the word begins with: "re-entry". 
- Compound modifiers: "You can find Calico easter eggs in read-only memory."


## Capitalization

### Proper nouns

Only capitalize proper nouns. 

### Headings

Use [sentence case](https://www.snappysentences.com/sentence-case-v-title-case/) 
for headings.


## Computer interfaces 

### Code in headings

Do not include backticks in headings. If one or more words in the heading 
is code, add descriptive text around it.

**Correct**:
```
# Setting the foo parameter
```

**Incorrect**:
```
# Setting `foo`
```

### Code samples

People often copy and paste the code that we provide. To prevent errors:

- Ensure that the code works. 

- Enclose variable values in `<` and `>` characters. In the text, 
  explicitly cite the variable by name and the need to replace it with an 
  actual value before attempting to execute the code.

- Do not include `$` to indicate terminal entries. Instead, mention 
  that the code is intended for entry in a terminal prompt in the 
  text.

- Separate commands from responses.

Example:

> 1. Use the command below to apply a policy. After replacing 
   `<your-policy>` with the name of the YAML file containing 
   your policy, issue the command from a terminal.
>
>    ```
>    calicoctl apply -f <your-policy>
>    ```
>   
> 1. It should return something like the following.
>
>    ```
>    Successfully applied 1 'policy' resource(s)
>    ```

### Docker images

Enclose the names of Docker images in backticks. Example: `calico/node`.

### URLs

#### URL versus URI

We prefer the term URL for reachable links over the more general URI. See 
[RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-1.1.3) 
for more discussion on this topic.

#### Link text

Do not include URLs that a reader might want to visit in the text. Instead, 
hyperlink a phrase that describes what the reader will see after following 
the link.

**Correct**:
```
Refer to [Understanding the birthday paradox](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/) 
for more information.
```

**Incorrect**:
```
For more information about the birthday paradox, 
[click here](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/).
```
```
This link provides more information about the birthday paradox: 
https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/.
```

#### External links

Append `{:target="_blank"}` to external links so that they open in 
a new tab. Example:
```
Refer to [the kubeadm getting started guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/){:target="_blank"} 
for detailed instructions.
```

#### Line breaks

Do not insert line breaks inside a URL. 


## Lists

### At least two items

A list should always contain at least two items. Do not use a list for only 
one item.

### Parallel construction

Items in a list should have parallel construction.

**Correct**:
- Orange
- Apple
- Banana

**Incorrect**:
- Floppy disks are so great
- Juju beans
- Don't forget the mayo!

### Capitalize first word

Capitalize the first word of each list item, even if it's not a complete
sentence.

### Nested lists

Avoid exceeding two levels of nesting in a list.

### Introductory text

When a section contains only a list and the heading text explains its 
contents clearly, you can omit introductory text. Example:

```
# Installing the Calico binary
 
1. [Download the binary](https://calico.org/downloads/latest-calico-binary) 
   to your local drive.
1. Make the binary executable.
   `chmod +x calico-binary`
1. Add the binary to your `$PATH`.
   `sudo mv ./calico-binary /usr/local/bin/calico-binary`

# Next heading
```

When including introductory content to precede a list, we prefer 
complete sentences. Example:

```
To add a node to your cluster, complete the following steps.

1. Open a terminal prompt.
...
```

### Punctuation

If the item is a complete sentence, include a period at the end. Otherwise,
omit trailing punctuation.

**Correct**
```
1. Ensure that you have an uninterrupted source of power.
1. Start the backup procedure.
1. Run some errands.
1. Check the status.
1. Have a snack.
1. Check the status.
```

**Incorrect**
```
1. Uninterrupted source of power.
1. Backup procedure.
1. Errands.
1. Status.
1. Snack.
1. Status.
```

**Incorrect**
```
Congratulations to the following winners of the Calico pop quiz:
- Joe,
- Bob, and
- Chris.
```


## Procedures

Use numbered lists to indicate a series of steps that should be performed 
in sequence. 

Avoid giving the reader more than one way to accomplish a task. Just 
describe the best method.


## Numbers and dates

Spell out numbers zero through nine. Use numeric form for 10 and above.

Spell out dates.
- **Correct**: January 1, 1970
- **Incorrect**: Jan 1, 1970
- **Incorrect**: 1/1/1970


## Acronyms and file types

Treat file types as acronyms when used in text. Use all caps. 
Examples: 
- "Download the YAML file."
- "Calico checks the CONF file."

To pluralize an acronym, add a lowercase "s". Example: "Deploy the VMs in 
a single click."


## Notes

While notes can help to call attention to important information, too 
many can clutter the page and exhaust the reader. 

For notes, use the following styles.

- `> **Tip**: ... {: .alert .alert-success}` : not everyone needs to 
  read it, but some might really appreciate and even enjoy the information.
- `> **Note**: ... {: .alert .alert-info}`: deserves special attention.
- `> **Important**: ... {: .alert .alert-danger}`: required reading.

Do not use `> **Warning**: ... {: .alert .alert-warning}`. This style 
is reserved for the note that appears at the top of the page to let people 
know they are viewing a version of the documentation other than the 
current release.


## Storage, memory, and speed abbreviations

Don't put a space between the number and the abbreviation. Examples: 500Kbps,
1.3GHz.

Don't add an "s" after the abbreviation to form a plural.

- **Correct**: "The system requires 1.9GB of memory."
- **Incorrect**: "The system requires 1.9GBs of memory."

Repeat the abbreviation in a series. Example: "The device offers 2MB, 4MB,
or 6MB of storage."


## American conventions

### Spelling

Many countries spell various English words in different ways. Use the 
American spelling. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling) 
provides a table that shows some of the primary deviations. You can 
also consult [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

### Numbers

Use a comma in whole numbers with four or more digits. Example: 1,200.

Use decimal points. Example, 2.5 pounds.

## Commonly confused

### a | an

Use "a" when the following word starts with a consonant sound. 
Examples: "a computer", " a user", "a hospital", "a UI".

Use "an" when the following word starts with a vowel sound. 
Examples: "an MBA", "an hour", "an Ethernet card", "an opaque object".

### affect | effect

Use "affect" to indicate influence. Example: "I was so affected 
by the performance, I began to cry."

Use "effect" to describe a causal relationship. Example: "They 
brought him on to effect change."

### assure | ensure | insure

When you "assure" someone, you make them feel more confident and 
remove their doubts. You can only assure human beings.

When you "ensure" something, you guarantee an outcome. 
Example: "Ensure that you have removed all traces of your activity 
before exiting the server." 

**Tip**: In technical documentation, the word "ensure" is usually 
the right choice.

The word "insure" shuld only be used in relation to actual insurers 
and insurance policies.

### data

Use data as singular, not plural. 

- **Correct**: "The data is..."
- **Incorrect**: "The data are..."

Use it as a mass noun, not a count noun.

- **Correct**: "less data"
- **Incorrect**: "fewer data"


### e.g. | i.e.

The abbreviation "e.g." refers to "exempli gratia" in Latin and means "for the sake of example." 

The abbreviation "i.e." refers to "id est" in Latin and means "that is."

**Tips**:
- Always use a comma before and after both abbreviations.
- Do not use both abbreviations in the same sentence.
- If you start a list with "e.g.", do not include "etc." at the end. 

### login | log in

Use "login" for the noun form. Use "log in" for verbs.

### its | it's

When forming a possessive of "it", omit the apostrophe. Example: "The 
company never regained its reputation after the breach."

Include an apostrophe only for the contractions of "it is" and "it 
has". Example: "It's very easy to install."

### setup | set up

Use "setup" for the noun or adjective form. Use "set up" for verbs.

### that | which

Use "that" to link an essential clause and "which" for inessential 
clauses. If the meaning of the sentence would remain the same if you 
deleted the clause, use "which". 

**Examples**:
- "Give me the book that is on the table." There may be any number 
  of books in the room, but the speaker wants the one on the table.

- "Give me the book, which is on the table." There is only one book 
  in the room and it happens to be on the table.
