title: Quickstart with Docker-Compose - Calico for Mesos CNI
sitemap: false 
---
This directory includes files for running a docker-compose demo of Calico for Mesos CNI.

Once running, this demo will run `etcd`, `mesos-master`, `marathon`, and `zookeeper`
in their own separate containers. It will also run a `agent` with its own
isolated docker-in-docker environment, with calico-node running inside.

We've simplified the commands into a Makefile for ease of use. If running the docker-compose
commands directly, be sure to pass the `-p mesoscni` flag.

## Prerequisites
- Linux host (we recommend Ubuntu 14.04), capable of volume mounting `/var/lib/modules`
- docker-compose

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-containers.git
cd calico/{{page.version}}/mesos/mesos/demo/cni/
```

### 2. Download and Build Images

```shell
make images
```

### 3. Start the Cluster

```shell
make cluster
```

### 4. Next Steps
Once your cluster has launched, access the Mesos-Master UI at `localhost:5050`, and Marathon UI at `localhost:8080`.

You can quickly launch a calico-networked task which runs `ifconfig` by running `make test-cni`:

```shell
$ make test-cni
docker exec mesoscni_mesosmaster_1 mesos-execute --containerizer=mesos --docker_image=busybox --name=cni --master=localhost:5050 --networks=calico-net-1 --command="ifconfig"

Check that your task was networked by calico by viewing its `stdout` log in the Mesos Master UI. If you see that eth0 has been assigned an IP from the default calico pool of 192.168.0.0/16, then it worked!
