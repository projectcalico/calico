To get started using Calico, we recommend running through one or more of the
available tutorials linked below.

These tutorials will help you understand the different environment options when
using Calico.  In most cases we provide worked examples using manual setup on
your own servers, a quick set-up in a virtualized environment using Vagrant and
a number of cloud services.

- [Calico with Kubernetes](kubernetes)
- [Calico with OpenShift](openshift/installation)
- [Host protection](bare-metal/bare-metal)

> **Note**: For integrations with the OpenStack, Mesos, DC/OS, and Docker 
> orchestrators, use [Calico v2.6](/v2.6/introduction/). We plan to resume 
> support for these orchestrators in a future v3.x release.
