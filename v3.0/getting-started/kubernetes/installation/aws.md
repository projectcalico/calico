There are a number of solutions for deploying Calico and Kubernetes on AWS.  We recommend taking
a look at the following solutions and guides which install Calico for networking and network policy on AWS.

Make sure you've read the [Calico AWS reference guide][aws-reference] for details on how to configure Calico and AWS.

#### Popular guides and tools

**[Heptio AWS Quickstart][heptio]** uses kubeadm and CloudFormation to build Kubernetes clusters on AWS using Calico
for networking and network policy enforcement.

as well as other public and private cloud environments.

**[CoreOS Kubernetes][coreos]** documentation to learn how to install, run and use Kubernetes on CoreOS Container Linux on AWS.

**[Kismatic Enterprise Toolkit][ket]** Fully-automated, production-grade Kubernetes operations on AWS and other clouds.

#### More installation options

If the out-of-the-box solutions listed above don't meet your requirements, you can install Calico for Kubernetes
on AWS using one of our [self-hosted manifests][self-hosted], or by [integrating Calico with your own configuration management][integration-guide].
