## calicoctl ipam commands


### calicoctl ipam release <IP>

This command allows you to release an IP address that had been previously
assigned to an endpoint.  When an IP address is released, it becomes available
for assignment to any endpoint.

Note that this does not remove the IP from any existing endpoints that may be
using it, so we generally recommend you use this command to clean up addresses
from endpoints that were not cleanly removed from Calico.

This command can be run on any Calico node.

Command syntax:

```
calicoctl ipam release <IP>

    <IP>: IP address to release.
```

Examples:

```
$ calicoctl ipam release 192.168.1.1
Address successfully released

$ calicoctl ipam release fd80:24e2:f998:72d6::1
Address successfully released
```

### calicoctl ipam info <IP>

This command prints information about a given IP address, such as special
attributes defined for the IP or whether the IP has been reserved by a user of
the Calico IPAM.

This command can be run on any Calico node.

Command syntax:

```
calicoctl ipam info <IP>

    <IP>: IP address desired to view information about.
```

Examples:

```
# IP is not assigned to an endpoint
$ calicoctl ipam info 192.168.1.2
IP 192.168.1.2 is not currently assigned

# Basic Docker container has the assigned IP
$ calicoctl ipam info 192.168.1.1
No attributes defined for 192.168.1.1
```
