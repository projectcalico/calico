title: Policy Resource (policy)
---

A Policy resource (policy) represents an ordered set of rules which are applied
to a collection of endpoints which match a [label selector](#selector).

Policy resources can be used to define network connectivity rules between groups of Calico endpoints and host endpoints, and
take precedence over [Profile resources]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/resources/profile) if any are defined.

For `calicoctl` commands that specify a resource type on the CLI, the following
aliases are supported (all case insensitive): `policy`, `policies`, `pol`, `pols`.

### Sample YAML

This sample policy allows TCP traffic from `frontend` endpoints to port 6379 on
`database` endpoints.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: policy
metadata:
  name: allow-tcp-6379
spec:
  selector: role == 'database'
  ingress:
  - action: allow
    protocol: tcp
    source:
      selector: role == 'frontend'
    destination:
      ports:
      - 6379
  egress:
  - action: allow
```

#### Spec

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                           | Accepted Values | Schema                | Default |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------|
| order      | Indicates ordering of this policy: policies with lower order are applied earlier.  No value means that the policy is applied last.                    |                 | float                 |         |
| selector   | Selects the endpoints to which this policy applies.                                                                                                   |                 | [selector](#selector) | all()   |
| ingress    | Ordered list of ingress rules applied by policy.                                                                                                      |                 | List of [Rule](#rule) |         |
| egress     | Ordered list of egress rules applied by this policy.                                                                                                  |                 | List of [Rule](#rule) |         |
| doNotTrack | Indicates to apply the rules in this policy before any data plane connection tracking, and that packets allowed by these rules should not be tracked. | true, false     | boolean               | false   |
| preDNAT    | Indicates to apply the rules in this policy before any DNAT.                                                                                          | true, false     | boolean               | false   |
| types      | Specifies explicitly whether the policy applies to ingress traffic, or to egress, or to both. | | List of strings, which may each be 'ingress' or 'egress'. | See below. |

The `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` fields are meaningful only when applying policy to a
[host endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/resources/hostendpoint).
Only one of them may be set to `true` (in a given policy).  If they are both `false`, or when applying the policy to a
[workload endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/resources/workloadendpoint),
the policy is enforced after connection tracking and any DNAT.

See [Using Calico to Secure Host Interfaces]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/bare-metal/bare-metal)
for how `doNotTrack` and `preDNAT` can be useful for host endpoints.

The `types` field is useful when a policy specifies no ingress rules and you
want that to mean that no ingress should be allowed, to each endpoint to which
that policy applies, except as allowed by any other policies that apply to that
endpoint.  You can express that by including `ingress` as one of the values of
the `types` field - effectively saying "please apply this policy to ingress
traffic, even though it looks like it should not."

Similarly, when a policy specifies no egress rules and you want that to mean
that no egress should be allowed ..., you can express that by including
`egress` as one of the values of the `types` field.

When `types` is not specified (or if it is an empty list), Calico treats the
policy as applicable to ingress traffic (to the selected endpoints) if it has
any ingress rules, or if it has neither ingress nor egress rules - with the
latter case meaning to deny ingress by default - and to egress traffic (from
the selected endpoints) only if it has any egress rules.

| Ingress rules present? | Egress rules present? | Default `types`   | Other allowed `types` settings, and their meaning                                                     |
|------------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No                     | No                    | `ingress`         | `egress` - Restrict egress instead of ingress.  `ingress, egress` - Restrict both ingress and egress. |
|------------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes                    | No                    | `ingress`         | `ingress, egress` - Restrict egress as well as ingress.                                               |
|------------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No                     | Yes                   | `egress`          | `ingress, egress` - Restrict ingress as well as egress.                                               |
|------------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes                    | Yes                   | `ingress, egress` | None.                                                                                                 |

> Prior to v2.6.0, Calico behaved as though `types` was always `[ ingress,

> If you have existing YAML with policies without any ingress or egress rules,

#### Rule

| Field       | Description                 | Accepted Values   | Schema | Default    |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| action      | Action to perform when matching this rule. | allow, deny, log, pass | string | |
| protocol    | Positive protocol match.  | tcp, udp, icmp, icmpv6, sctp, udplite, integer 1-255. | string | |
| notProtocol | Negative protocol match. | tcp, udp, icmp, icmpv6, sctp, udplite, integer 1-255. | string | |
| icmp        | ICMP match criteria.     | | [ICMP](#icmp) | |
| notICMP     | Negative match on ICMP. | | [ICMP](#icmp) | |
| source      | Source match parameters. |  | [EntityRule](#entityrule) | |
| destination | Destination match parameters. |  | [EntityRule](#entityrule) | |

An `action` of `pass` will skip over the remaining Policies and jump to the
first Profile assigned to the endpoint, applying the policy configured in the
Profile; if there are no Profiles configured for the endpoint the default
applied action is deny.

#### ICMP

| Field       | Description                 | Accepted Values   | Schema | Default    |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| type | Match on ICMP type. | Can be integer 1-255 | integer |
| code | Match on ICMP code. | Can be integer 1-255 | integer |

| notTag                | Deprecated: Negative match on tag. |  | string | |
| nets                  | Match packets with IP in any of the listed CIDRs. | List of valid IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs  | list of cidrs |
| net                   | Deprecated (use "nets" instead): Match on CIDR. | Valid IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR  | cidr | |
| notNets               | Negative match on CIDRs. Match packets with IP not in any of the listed CIDRs. | List of valid IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs  | list of cidrs |
| notNet                | Deprecated (use "notNets" instead): Negative match on CIDR. | Valid IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR | cidr | |
| selector    | Positive match on selected endpoints. | Valid selector | [selector](#selector) | |
| notSelector | Negative match on selected endpoints. | Valid selector | [selector](#selector) | |
| ports | Positive match on the specified ports | | list of [ports](#ports) | |
