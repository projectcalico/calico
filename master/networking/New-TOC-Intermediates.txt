== SECURITY intermediates

Security
Description: Calico Network Policy and Global Network Policy are key to securing workloads and hosts and adopting a zero trust security model. 

Get started
Description: Understand the similarities and differences between Calico network policy and Kubernetes network policy.

Policy rules
Description: Learn to control traffic to/from endpoints using namespaces, service accounts, external IPs or networks, and ICMP ping in Calico network policy rules.

Policy for hosts
Description: Use the same Calico network policy configuration for workloads to restrict traffic between hosts and the outside world. 

Policy for Kubernetes services
Description: Apply policy to Kubernetes node ports, and to services exposed externally as cluster IPs.

Policy for Istio
Description: Create standard Calico network policies with application layer specific attributes for Istio service mesh.

Policy for extreme traffic
Description: Apply Calico network policy early in the Linux packet processing pipeline to avoid DoS attacks, and selectively bypass Linux conntrack for extremely large number of connections.
