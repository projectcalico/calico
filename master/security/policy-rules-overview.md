### Big picture

Use label selectors to apply policy rules in {{site.prodname}} network policy and global network policy. 

If you've read [Get started with Calico policy]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/security/calico-network-policy) and [Kubernetes policy]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/security/kubernetes-network-policy) and done the tutorials, you already know how to use label selectors to apply policy rules. If you need more help, the Policy rules section provides more examples of specific rules. 

For the complete list of policy rules, see:
