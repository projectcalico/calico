title: Installing Calico on Kubernetes

canonical_url: https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/

We provide a number of manifests to get you up and running with {{site.prodname}} in
just a few steps. Refer to the section that corresponds to your desired networking
for instructions.

- [Installing {{site.prodname}} for policy and networking (recommended)](calico)

- [Installing {{site.prodname}} for policy and flannel for networking](flannel)

- [Installing {{site.prodname}} for policy (advanced)](other)

After installing {{site.prodname}}, you can [enable application layer policy](app-layer-policy).
Enabling application layer policy also secures workload-to-workload communications with mutual 
TLS authentication.

Should you wish to modify the manifests before applying them, refer to
[Customizing the manifests](config-options).

If you prefer not to use Kubernetes to start the {{site.prodname}} services, refer to the
[Integration guide](integration).

## Third-party solutions

Several third-party vendors also provide tools to install Kubernetes with {{site.prodname}} in a variety of
environments.
