## Kubernetes requirements

#### Supported versions

We test {{site.prodname}} {{page.version}} against the following Kubernetes versions.
- 1.8
- 1.9
- 1.10

Other versions are likely to work, but we do not actively test {{site.prodname}} 
{{page.version}} against them.

Application Layer Policy requires Kubernetes 1.9 or later.

#### CNI plug-in enabled

{{site.prodname}} is installed as a CNI plugin. The kubelet must be configured 
to use CNI networking by passing the `--network-plugin=cni` argument. (On 
kubeadm, this is the default.)

#### Other network providers

{{site.prodname}} must be the only network provider in each cluster. We do
not currently support migrating a cluster with another network provider to 
use {{site.prodname}} networking.
  
#### Supported kube-proxy modes

{{site.prodname}} supports the following kube-proxy modes:
- `iptables` (default)
- `ipvs` (beta) Requires Kubernetes >=v1.9.3. Refer to 
  [Enabling IPVS in Kubernetes](../../usage/enabling-ipvs) for more details.

#### IP pool configuration

The IP range selected for pod IP addresses cannot overlap with any other 
IP ranges in your network, including:

- The Kubernetes service cluster IP range
- The range from which host IPs are allocated 

Our manifests default to `192.168.0.0/16` for the pod IP range except [Canal/flannel](./installation/flannel), 
which defaults to `10.244.0.0/16`. Refer to [Configuring the pod IP range](./installation/config-options#configuring-the-pod-ip-range)
for information on modifying the defaults.

#### Mutating webhooks

Application Layer Policy requires [Mutating Webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook-beta-in-19) to be enabled.
