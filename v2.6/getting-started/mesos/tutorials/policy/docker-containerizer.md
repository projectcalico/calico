title: Network Policy (Docker Containerizer)
---

The Docker Containerizer uses Docker directly to launch tasks.
When using Calico with Mesos, it uses the standard Calico Docker networking
and IPAM plugins.

Refer to the Docker Tutorials, starting with
[Security using Calico Profiles]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/docker#tutorials)
to understand how to create different Calico networks and modify policy.
