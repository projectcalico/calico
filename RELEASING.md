# How to release Calico

> **NOTE:** These instructions apply only to Calico versions v3.2.0 or greater.
> For older releases, refer to the instructions in the corresponding `release-vX.Y` branch.

## Overview

This repository contains documentation and packaging, but no Calico code.

Releases of this repository still serve several important purposes. Namely, they provide:

- a single Calico release with user-facing release notes and documentation.
- a packaging of individual Calico component releases into a single `.tgz` file

## Prerequisites

To release Calico, you need **the following permissions**:

- Write access to the core repositories in the projectcalico/ GitHub organization.
- Push access to the Calico DockerHub repositories. Assuming you've been granted access by an admin:

    ```
    docker login
    ```

- Push access to the Calico quay.io repositories. Assuming you've been granted access by an admin:

    ```
    docker login quay.io
    ```

- Push access to the gcr.io/projectcalico-org repositories. **Note:** Some of the repos do not yet support credential helpers, you must use one of the token-based logins.  For example, assuming you've been granted access, this will configure a short-lived auth token:

    ```
    gcloud auth print-access-token | docker login -u oauth2accesstoken --password-stdin https://gcr.io
    ```

You'll also need **several GB of disk space** (~7GB for v3.4.0, for example).

Some of the release scripts also require **tools to be installed** in your dev environment:

- [Install and configure](https://github.com/github/hub#installation) the GitHub `hub` tool.
- Create a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for Github and export it as the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  env var (for example by adding it to your `.profile`).
- Install the "GitHub release" tool, `ghr`:

    ```
    go get -u github.com/tcnksm/ghr
    ```

Finally, the release process **assumes that your repos are checked out with name `origin`** for the git remote
for the main Calico repo.

## Releasing the subcomponents

Before attempting to create a Calico release you must do the following.

1. Choose a Calico version number, e.g. `v3.2.0`.

1. Verify that the code and GitHub are in the right state for releasing for the chosen version.

   - Make sure all components have up-to-date libcalico-go pins.
   - Make sure node has up-to-date pins for felix and confd.
   - Make sure felix and confd both have an up-to-date typha pin.
   - [Make sure the Milestone is empty](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aprojectcalico+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A%22Calico+vX.Y.Z%22+) either by merging PRs, or kicking them out of the Milestone.
   - [Make sure that there are no pending cherry-pick PRs](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aprojectcalico+label%3Acherry-pick-candidate) relevant to the release.
   - [Make sure there are no pending PRs which need docs](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+user%3Aprojectcalico+label%3Adocs-pr-required+) for this release.
   - [Make sure each PR with a release note is within a Milestone](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aprojectcalico+no%3Amilestone+label%3Arelease-note-required).
   - [Make sure CI is passing](https://semaphoreci.com/calico) for the target release branch.

1. Select the appropriate component version numbers, and create any necessary releases. Follow the instructions
   in each repository for further information. (See recent release information, e.g. at
   https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.7/release-notes/, for the set of components to consider releasing.)

   The following components _must_ use the same version number as the Calico version number
   chosen above, and thus must be re-released for every Calico release.

   - [calico/node](https://github.com/projectcalico/node/releases)
   - [calico/ctl](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/releases)
   - [calico/cni](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin/releases)
   - [calico/kube-controllers](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/releases)
   - [calico/felix](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/releases)
   - [calico/typha](https://github.com/projectcalico/typha/releases)
   - [calico/dikastes](https://github.com/projectcalico/app-policy/releases)
   - [calico/pod2daemon-flexvol](https://github.com/projectcalico/pod2daemon/releases)

   The following components _must_ use the same minor revision number as the Calico version number above, but
   do not always need to be released for every patch. They must be cut as part of a minor release of Calico.

   - [networking-calico](https://github.com/openstack/networking-calico)

   The following components do not share a version with the Calico release, but are included in the documentation.

   - [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/releases)

## Preparing to cut a Calico release

1. Check out the `master` branch of this repository and make sure it is up-to-date
   and [passing Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/calico/calico/branches/master).

   ```
   git checkout master && git pull origin master
   ```

Your next steps depend on the type of release:

- [Creating a new major/minor release](#major-minor)
  1. [Creating a docs directory prior to release](#docs-dir)
  1. [Building and publishing a new major/minor release](#build)
  1. [Promoting a new major/minor release](#promoting)
- [Creating a patch release](#patch)


## <a name="major-minor"></a> Creating a new major / minor release

### <a name="docs-dir"></a> Creating a docs directory prior to release

This section describes how to create a docs directory for a new major or minor release. This is typically done
at the same time that release branches are cut, often well before the release is built and published.

1. Create a new branch off of the latest master.

   ```
   git checkout -b <NEW_PERSONAL_BRANCH>
   ```

1. Create the release-versioned directories for the documentation, copying from master directories.

   ```
   python2 ./release-scripts/do_release.py
   ```

1. Add a new "dummy" version to the bottom of `_data/versions.yml`. Add a comment indicating this is to be removed
   when the real release is cut.

   This ensures the release is not listed as the "Latest release" in the documentation. Populate the
   section with tags indicating the corresponding minor release branch.

   For example:

   ```
    v2.1
      # Pre-release placeholder for Calico v2.1. Delete this when v2.1.0 goes live.
      - title: v2.1.0-pre-release
        note: ""
        components:
          typha:
            version: release-v2.1
        ... etc ...
   ```

1. Add a section in `_config.yml` so that `page.version` will be set correctly in the new subdirectory:

   ```
   -
     scope:
       path: vX.Y
     values:
       version: vX.Y
   ```

1. If appropriate, update the list of tested versions for different platforms in the appropriate documents.

   - Kubernetes `vX.Y/getting-started/kubernetes/requirements.md`
   - OpenShift `vX.Y/getting-started/openshift/requirements.md`
   - OpenStack `vX.Y/getting-started/openstack/requirements.md`
   - Host protection `vX.Y/getting-started/bare-metal/requirements.md`

1. Commit your changes and submit a PR for review. For example:

   ```
   git commit -a -m "Create docs directory for vX.Y"
   ```

### <a name="build"></a> Building and publishing a new major/minor release

This section describes how to create a new major or minor release. It assumes that the docs directory has already been created in master
as described in the section above.

1. Create a new branch off of the latest master.

   ```
   git checkout -b <NEW_PERSONAL_BRANCH>
   ```

1. Add the new version to the correct release section in `_data/versions.yml`.

1. Update the AUTHORS.md file. This will require `GITHUB_TOKEN` be set in your environment.

   ```
   make update-authors
   ```

1. Follow the steps in [writing release notes](#release-notes) to generate or update candidate release notes.

   Then, add the newly created release note file to git.

   ```
   git add _data/<VERSION>/release-notes/<VERSION>-release-notes.md
   ```

1. (Optional) Review `_config_dev.yml` and edit it to exclude any previous releases that are no longer actively developed. This
   ensures developer builds remain fast by excluding directories which are not in active development.

1. Commit your changes. For example:

   ```
   git commit -m "Updates for release vX.Y.Z"
   ```

1. Run the following on your local branch in order to build the release
   at the newly created commit.

   ```
   make RELEASE_STREAM=vX.Y release
   ```

   Then, publish the tag and release to github.

   ```
   make RELEASE_STREAM=vX.Y release-publish
   ```

1. Push your branch and open a pull request. Get it reviewed and wait for it to pass CI.

   Once reviewed and CI is passing, merge the PR. This will cause the
   live docs site to be updated (after a few minutes).


If the release is not a release candidate but in fact a stable release, then you must also
follow the steps in the next section for promoting a release candidate to a final release.

## <a name="promoting"></a> Promoting to a final release

The following steps outline how to promote a major / minor release candidate to the latest
release in the documentation. These steps should be performed after completing the steps above
for [building and publishing a new minor / major release](#build).

Perform the following steps on a local branch off of the latest master.

### Promoting to be the latest release in the docs

1. Add a new `<li>` entry to the `<span class="dropdown">` in `_layouts/docwithnav.html` file.

1. Modify the redirect in `/index.html` to point to your new release.

1. Move the section for the release in `_data/versions.yml` to the top of the file so that it will be
   the 'Latest Release', and **remove any release candidates or dummy releases** from the section.

1. Run `make add_redirects_for_latest VERSION=vX.Y` to update the redirects.

1. Commit your current changes.

1. Update `sitemap-latest.xml` in the root of the repository. This is still a manual process. Use `_site/sitemap.xml` as a guide.

1. Commit the sitemap changes as a new commit and open a pull request, make sure it passes CI and get it reviewed.

   Once reviewed and CI has passed, merge the PR. This will cause the live docs site to be updated (after a few minutes).

### Updating canonical redirects

1. Pull the latest master and check out a _new_ branch.

1. Run this command to update canonical URLs:

   ```
   make update_canonical_urls
   ```

1. Submit a PR with the canonical link changes, make sure it passes CI, and get it reviewed and merged.

## <a name="patch"></a> Performing a "patch" release

### Creating the release

1. On a new branch, add the new version to the correct release section in `_data/versions.yml`

1. Follow the steps in [writing release notes](#release-notes) to generate candidate release notes.

   Then, add the newly created release note file to git.

   ```
   git add _data/<VERSION>/release-notes/<VERSION>-release-notes.md
   ```

1. Commit your changes. For example:

   ```
   git commit -m "Updates for release vX.Y.Z"
   ```

1. Push your branch and open a pull request. Get it reviewed and wait for it to pass CI.

1. Once reviewed and CI is passing, run the following on your local branch in order to build and publish the release
   at the newly created commit.

   ```
   make RELEASE_STREAM=vX.Y release
   ```

   Then, publish the tag and release.

   ```
   make RELEASE_STREAM=vX.Y release-publish
   ```
1. Merge the PR. This will cause the live docs site to be updated (after a few minutes).

# Release notes

Release notes for a Calico release contain notable changes across Calico repositories. To write
release notes for a given version, perform the following steps.

1. Check the merged pull requests in the milestone and make sure each has a release note if it needs one.

   Use this URL to query for PRs, replacing `vX.Y.Z` with your desired version.

   ```
   https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aprojectcalico+milestone%3A%22Calico+vX.Y.Z%22+
   ```

   Each PR that wants a release note must meet the following conditions to have its release note considered:

   - It is in the correct `Calico vX.Y.Z` GitHub milestone
   - It has the `release-note-required` label
   - It has one or more release notes included in the description (Optional).

1. Run the following command to collect all release notes for the given version.

   ```
   make RELEASE_STREAM=vX.Y release-notes
   ```

   A file called `<VERSION>-release-notes.md` will be created with the raw release note content.

   > **NOTE**: If you receive a ratelimit error, you can specify a `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the above command to
   > increase the number of allowed API calls. [See here for details](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).

1. Edit the generated file.

   The release notes should be edited to highlight a few major enhancements and their value to the user. Bug fixes and other changes should be summarized in a
   bulleted list at the end of the release notes. Any limitations or incompatible changes in behavior should be explicitly noted.

   Consistent release note formatting is important. Here are some examples for reference:

   - [Example release notes for a major/minor release](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/v3.1.0/_includes/v3.1/release-notes/v3.1.0-release-notes.md)
