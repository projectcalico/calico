title: Host endpoint
canonical_url: '/reference/resources/hostendpoint'
---

A host endpoint resource (`HostEndpoint`) represents one or more real or virtual interfaces
attached to a host that is running {{site.prodname}}.  It enforces {{site.prodname}} policy on
the traffic that is entering or leaving the host's default network namespace through those
interfaces.

-  A host endpoint with `interfaceName: *` represents _all_ of a host's real or virtual
   interfaces.

-  A host endpoint for one specific real interface is configured by `interfaceName: <name-of-that-interface>`,
   for example `interfaceName: eth0`, or by leaving `interfaceName`
   empty and including one of the interface's IPs in `expectedIPs`.

Each host endpoint may include a set of labels and list of profiles that {{site.prodname}}
will use to apply
[policy]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/resources/networkpolicy)
to the interface.

**Default behavior of external traffic to/from host**

If a host endpoint is added and network policy is not in place, the {{ site.prodname }} default is to deny traffic to/from that endpoint (except for traffic allowed by failsafe rules). For host endpoints, {{ site.prodname }} blocks traffic only to/from interfaces that itâ€™s been explicitly told about in network policy. Traffic to/from other interfaces is ignored.

> **Note**: Currently, for host endpoints with `interfaceName: *`, only [pre-DNAT
> policy]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/host-endpoints/pre-dnat) is
> implemented.

For `calicoctl` [commands]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/) that specify a resource type on the CLI, the following
aliases are supported (all case insensitive): `hostendpoint`, `hostendpoints`, `hep`, `heps`.

> **Important**: When rendering security rules on other hosts, {{site.prodname}} uses the
> `expectedIPs` field to resolve label selectors to IP addresses. If the `expectedIPs` field
> is omitted then security rules that use labels will fail to match this endpoint.
