In this example, a user wants to spin up a machine to use as a Linux
development environment. This user has a straightforward use-case: they
want a GUI and SSH access, but relatively little else.

This user is provisioned with a single OpenStack user and single
OpenStack tenant. Neutron will automatically provision them with a
single security group, `default`, that contains the following rules:

-   allow all inbound traffic from machines in the `default` security
    group
-   allow all outbound traffic to anywhere

Per the instructions in [IP addressing and connectivity](connectivity), this user cannot create
Neutron networks or subnets, but they do have access to the networks
created by the administrator: `external` and `internal`.

Because the user wants to be able to reach the machine from their own
laptop, they need the machine to be reachable from outside the data
center. In vanilla Neutron, this would mean provisioning it with a
floating IP, but in {{site.prodname}} they instead want to make sure the VM is
attached to the `external` network. To add themselves to this network,
the user needs to find out the UUID for it.

```bash
neutron net-list
```

This should return something like the following.

```bash
+--------------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| id                                   | name     | subnets                                                  |
+--------------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| 8d5dec25-a6aa-4e18-8706-a51637a428c2 | external | 54db559c-5e1d-4bdc-83b0-c479ef2a0ead 172.18.208.0/24     |
|                                      |          | cf6ceea0-dde0-4018-ab9a-f8f68935622b 2001:db8:a41:2::/64 |
| fa52b704-7b3c-4c83-8698-244807352711 | internal | 301b3e63-5324-4d62-8e22-ed8dddd50689 10.65.0.0/16        |
|                                      |          | bf94ccb1-c57c-4c9a-a873-c20cbfa4ecaf 2001:db8:a41:3::/64 |
+--------------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+

In the example above, the `external` network has the UUID
`8d5dec25-a6aa-4e18-8706-a51637a428c2`. Thus, the machine can be created
with the following `nova boot` command.

```
nova boot --flavor m1.medium                                  \
          --image debian-wheezy-amd64                         \
          --security-groups default                           \
          --nic "netid=8d5dec25-a6aa-4e18-8706-a51637a428c2"  \
          development-server
```

This places the VM with a single NIC in the `external` network. The VM
starts to boot, and Neutron allocates it an IP address in the `external`
network: in this case, both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, as you can see
below:

```
+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Property                             | Value                                                     |
+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| external network                     | 2001:db8:a41:2::1c, 172.18.208.85                         |
| flavor                               | m1.medium (3)                                             |
| hostId                               | b80247c27400fc9048ca569c8635f00801654bf676a00d8f08887215  |
| id                                   | e36f4e62-0efa-4188-87b8-8c96dc6e6028                      |
| name                                 | development-server                                        |
| security_groups                      | default                                                   |
+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

While the machine boots, the security group can be configured. It needs
four extra rules: one for SSH and three for VNC. In this example,
developer's personal machine has the IPv4 address 191.64.52.12, and
that's the only machine they'd like to be able to access their machine.
For that reason, they add the four security group rules as follows.

To add the SSH ingress rule:

```bash
neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol tcp                      \
                                   --port-range-min 22                 \
                                   --port-range-max 22                 \
                                   --direction ingress                 \
                                   --remote-ip-prefix 191.64.52.12/32  \
                                   --ethertype IPv4                    \
                                   default
```

To add the first VNC rule:

```bash
neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol tcp                      \
                                   --port-range-min 5800               \
                                   --port-range-max 5801               \
                                   --direction ingress                 \
                                   --remote-ip-prefix 191.64.52.12/32  \
                                   --ethertype IPv4                    \
                                   default
```

To add the second VNC rule:

```bash
neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol tcp                      \
                                   --port-range-min 5900               \
                                   --port-range-max 5901               \
                                   --direction ingress                 \
                                   --remote-ip-prefix 191.64.52.12/32  \
                                   --ethertype IPv4                    \
                                   default
```

To add the third VNC rule:

```bash
neutron security-group-rule-create --protocol tcp                      \
                                   --port-range-min 6000               \
                                   --port-range-max 6001               \
                                   --direction ingress                 \
                                   --remote-ip-prefix 191.64.52.12/32  \
                                   --ethertype IPv4                    \
                                   default
```

At this stage, the developer's machine is up and running. It can be
reached on its public IP (172.18.208.85), and the developer confirms
this by SSHing into their box. They're now ready to go.
