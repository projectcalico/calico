## If you could solve these 3 problems today...

  #### Workload access controls

  Implement pod-level workload access controls and protect containerized environments in the Kubernetes cluster from outside threats, while enabling applications and workloads to securely communicate with resources outside the cluster behind a firewall or other control point.

  #### Compliance

  Create compliance policies for any compliance framework including PCI, SOC 2, and more. Continuously monitor compliance for your container, Kubernetes, and cloud environment. Retain a daily history of your compliance status. Generate on-demand or scheduled audit reports.

  #### Faster troubleshooting

  Enable faster troubleshooting of Kubernetes workloads and applications with Service Graph, Packet Capture, anomaly detection, and performance hotspots, leading to shorter time-to-resolution, less application downtime, and improved quality of service

## then take your cluster into Calico Cloud and see for yourself!
