It will take a few minutes for Calico to finish
installing on your cluster. You can check the status of the installation by
visiting Calico's web status interface:

 - Go to the **Services** tab
 - Select "calico-install-framework" in the list of running services
   (note that it may take a few minutes for Calico
    to appear).
 - Once the Calico service is `Healthy`,
   Select the "calico-install-framework" task.
 - Click the Endpoint URL to open the Calico status page in a new tab.

## Further Reading

This concludes the installation of Calico for DC/OS! Before you start
launching IP-per-container applications with Calico policy,
review the following information which may apply to your deployment.

#### AWS

DC/OS users on Amazon Web Services should view
[Calico's AWS reference]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/public-cloud/aws)
for information on how to configure AWS networking for use with Calico.

#### Note on Cluster Impact

The Installation method detailed above will affect availability of all Agents
in the cluster in order to work around two limitations in DC/OS 1.8:

1. [Mesos-Agents require a restart to detect newly added CNI networks](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6567).
2. [DC/OS does not configure Docker with a Cluster-Store](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/browse/DCOS-155)
a [requirement for Multi-host docker networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/#/overlay-networking-with-an-external-key-value-store).

Because of these two limitations, Calico-DC/OS will restart each agent process
and restart each docker daemon. Learn how to handle this installation steps manually
and prevent cluster availability impact by viewing the [Custom Install Guide](custom).

#### Deploying Applications

Once installed, see the [standard usage guides]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/mesos#tutorials)
