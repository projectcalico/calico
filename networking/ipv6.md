title: Configure dual stack or IPv6 only
description: Configure dual stack or IPv6 only for workloads.

### Big picture

Configure {{site.prodname}} IP address allocation to use dual stack or IPv6 only for workload communications.

### Value

Workload communication over IPv6 is increasingly desirable, as well as or instead of IPv4. {{site.prodname}} supports:

- **IPv4 only** (default)

  Each workload gets an IPv4 address, and can communicate over IPv4. 

- **Dual stack**

  Each workload gets an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, and can communicate over IPv4 or IPv6. 

- **IPv6 only**
   
  Each workload gets an IPv6 address, and can communicate over IPv6.

### Features

This how-to guide uses the following {{site.prodname}} features:

- **CNI plugin configuration** with `assign_ipv6` and `assign_ipv4` flags
- **IPPool**

### Before you begin

**{{site.prodname}} requirements** 

- {{site.prodname}} IPAM  

**Kubernetes version requirements**
  - For dual stack, 1.16 and later
  - For one IP stack at a time (IPv4 or IPv6), any Kubernetes version

**Kubernetes IPv6 host requirements**
  - An IPv6 address that is reachable from the other hosts
  - The sysctl setting, `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding`, is set to `1`.    
    This ensures both Kubernetes service traffic and {{site.prodname}} traffic is forwarded appropriately.
  - A default IPv6 route
  
**Kubernetes IPv4 host requirements**
  - An IPv4 address that is reachable from the other hosts
  - The sysctl setting, `net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding`, is set to `1`.    
    This ensures both Kubernetes service traffic and {{site.prodname}} traffic is forwarded appropriately.
  - A default IPv4 route

>**Note**: The following tasks are for new clusters.
{: .alert .alert-info}

**Manifest install**
- [Enable dual stack, manifest install](#enable-dual-stack-manifest-install)
- [Enable IPv6 only, manifest install](#enable-ipv6-only-manifest-install)

**Operator install**
- [Enable dual stack, operator install](#enable-dual-stack-operator-install)

**Optional**

#### Enable dual stack, manifest install

1. Set up a new cluster following the Kubernetes {% include open-new-window.html text='prerequisites' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#prerequisites' %} and {% include open-new-window.html text='enablement steps' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#enable-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack' %}.

1. Using the [{{site.prodname}} Kubernetes install guide]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/kubernetes/self-managed-onprem/onpremises), download the correct {{site.prodname}} manifest for the cluster and datastore type. 

1. Edit the CNI config (`calico-config` ConfigMap in the manifest), and enable IPv4 and IPv6 address allocation by setting both fields to true.

   ```
       "ipam": {
           "type": "calico-ipam",
           "assign_ipv4": "true",
           "assign_ipv6": "true"
       },
   ```

1. Configure IPv6 support and the default IPv6 IP pool by adding the following variable settings to the environment for the `calico-node` container:

   | Variable name | Value |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `IP6`         | `autodetect` |
| `CALICO_IPV6POOL_CIDR` | The same as the IPv6 range you configured as the cluster CIDR to kube-controller-manager and kube-proxy |
| `FELIX_IPV6SUPPORT` | `true` |

1. Apply the edited manifest with `kubectl apply -f`. 
 
   New pods will get IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4, and can communicate with each other and the outside world over IPv6.

#### Enable IPv6 only, manifest install

1. Set up a new cluster following the Kubernetes {% include open-new-window.html text='prerequisites' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#prerequisites' %} and {% include open-new-window.html text='enablement steps' url='https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#enable-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack' %}.

1. Using the [{{site.prodname}} Kubernetes install guide]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/kubernetes/self-managed-onprem/onpremises), download the correct {{site.prodname}} manifest for the cluster and datastore type. 

1. Edit the CNI config (calico-config ConfigMap in the manifest) to disable IPv4 assignments and enable IPv6 assignments.
   ```
       "ipam": {
           "type": "calico-ipam",
           "assign_ipv4": "false",
           "assign_ipv6": "true"
       },
   ```

1. Configure IPv6 support and the default IPv6 IP pool by adding the following variable settings to the environment for the `calico-node` container:

   | Variable name | Value |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `IP6`         | `autodetect` |
| `CALICO_IPV6POOL_CIDR` | The same as the IPv6 range you configured as the cluster CIDR to kube-controller-manager and kube-proxy |
| `FELIX_IPV6SUPPORT` | `true` |

1. Apply the edited manifest with `kubectl apply -f`. 

   New pods will get IPv6 addresses, and can communicate with each other and the outside world over IPv6.

#### Change host IPv4 addresses to IPv6 only

To switch the host to use IPv6 only, follow these additional steps.

1. Disable [IP autodetection of IPv4]({{site.baseurl}}//networking/ip-autodetection) by setting `IP` to `none`.
1. Calculate the {{site.prodname}} BGP router ID for IPv6 using either of the following methods.
   - Set the environment variable `CALICO_ROUTER_ID=hash` on {{site.nodecontainer}}.     
     This configures {{site.prodname}} to calculate the router ID based on the hostname.
   - Pass a unique value for `CALICO_ROUTER_ID` to each node individually.
