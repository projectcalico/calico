                  the block is written. Each allocation will also store the sequence
                  number of the block at the time of its creation. When releasing
                  an IP, passing the sequence number associated with the allocation
                  allows us to protect against a race condition and ensure the IP
                  hasn't been released and re-allocated since the release request.
