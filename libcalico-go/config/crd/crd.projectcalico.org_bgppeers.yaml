                  Option to keep the original nexthop field when routes are sent to a BGP Peer.
                  Setting "true" configures the selected BGP Peers node to use the "next hop keep;"
                  instead of "next hop self;"(default) in the specific branch of the Node on "bird.cfg".
                  Note: that this field is deprecated. Users should use the NextHopMode field to control
                  the next hop attribute for a BGP peer.

                  Time to allow for software restart.  When specified, this is configured as the graceful

                description: |-
                  NextHopMode defines the method of calculating the next hop attribute for received routes.
                  This replaces and expands the deprecated KeepOriginalNextHop field.
                  Users should use this setting to control the next hop attribute for a BGP peer.
                  When this is set, the value of the KeepOriginalNextHop field is ignored.
                  if neither keepOriginalNextHop or nextHopMode is specified, BGP's default behaviour is used.
                  Set it to “Auto” to apply BGP’s default behaviour.
                  Set it to "Self" to configure "next hop self;" in "bird.cfg".
                  Set it to "Keep" to configure "next hop keep;" in "bird.cfg".
