                    Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods.

                    A maximum of 25 rules is allowed in this block.

                    The relative precedence of egress rules within a single CNP object
                    (all of which share the priority) will be determined by the order
                    in which the rule is written.
                    Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
                    would take the highest precedence.
                    CNPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                    The relative precedence of ingress rules within a single CNP object
                    (all of which share the priority) will be determined by the order

                    Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the ingress rules
                    would take the highest precedence.
                    CNPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.

                            Kubernetes network policy, it is still possible that the

                            high-layers e.g. service mesh.

                            processed.

                            current tier for the selected traffic, and passes
                            evaluation to the next tier.

                    careful about assigning the priorities for policies with rules that will
                    match many connections, and ensure that policies have unique priority

                  description: |-
                    Tier is used as the top-level grouping for network policy prioritization.

                    Policy tiers are evaluated in the following order:
                    * Admin tier
                    * NetworkPolicy tier
                    * Baseline tier

                    ClusterNetworkPolicy can use 2 of these tiers: Admin and Baseline.

                    The Admin tier takes precedence over all other policies. Policies
                    defined in this tier are used to set cluster-wide security rules
                    that cannot be overridden in the other tiers. If Admin tier has
                    made a final decision (Accept or Deny) on a connection, then no
                    further evaluation is done.

                    NetworkPolicy tier is the tier for the namespaced v1.NetworkPolicy.
                    These policies are intended for the application developer to describe
                    the security policy associated with their deployments inside their
                    namespace. v1.NetworkPolicy always makes a final decision for selected
                    pods. Further evaluation only happens for Pods not selected by a
                    v1.NetworkPolicy.

                    Baseline tier is a cluster-wide policy that can be overridden by the
                    v1.NetworkPolicy. If Baseline tier has made a final decision (Accept or
                    Deny) on a connection, then no further evaluation is done.

                    If a given connection wasn't allowed or denied by any of the tiers,
                    the default kubernetes policy is applied, which says that
                    all pods can communicate with each other.
