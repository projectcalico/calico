                            operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
                            Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

                            values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                            the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                            the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                            merge patch.

                      matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                      map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                      operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                  List of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to.
                  Valid options are Ingress, Egress, or Ingress,Egress.
                  If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of Ingress or Egress rules;
                  policies that contain an Egress section are assumed to affect Egress, and all policies
                  (whether or not they contain an Ingress section) are assumed to affect Ingress.
                  If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress" ].
                  Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed,
                  you must specify a policyTypes value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include
                  an Egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]).
