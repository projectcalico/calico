                    Each positive match criteria has a negated version, prefixed with "Not". All the match

                            For NetworkPolicy, an empty NamespaceSelector implies that the Selector is limited to selecting
                            only workload endpoints in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.

                            For NetworkPolicy, `global()` NamespaceSelector implies that the Selector is limited to selecting
                            only GlobalNetworkSet or HostEndpoint.

                            For GlobalNetworkPolicy, an empty NamespaceSelector implies the Selector applies to workload
                            endpoints across all namespaces.

                  policy will be applied last.  Policies with identical order will be applied in
                  alphanumerical order based on the Policy "Name" within the tier.

                  PerformanceHints contains a list of hints to Calico's policy engine to
                  help process the policy more efficiently.  Hints never change the
                  enforcement behaviour of the policy.

                  Currently, the only available hint is "AssumeNeededOnEveryNode".  When
                  that hint is set on a policy, Felix will act as if the policy matches
                  a local endpoint even if it does not. This is useful for "preloading"
                  any large static policies that are known to be used on every node.
                  If the policy is _not_ used on a particular node then the work
                  done to preload the policy (and to maintain it) is wasted.

                  Types according to what Ingress and Egress are present in the policy.  The
                  default is:

                  - [ PolicyTypeIngress ], if there are no Egress rules (including the case where there are

                  - [ PolicyTypeIngress, PolicyTypeEgress ], if there are both Ingress and Egress rules.

                  When the policy is read back again, Types will always be one of these values, never empty
