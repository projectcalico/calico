### Developing against libcalico-go

If you wish to use libcalico for integrating with Calico networking and

the client.

-  Documentation for the client is in [lib/client GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/lib/client).
-  The resource structure definitions are defined in [lib/apis](https://godoc.org/github.com/projectcalico/libcalico-go/lib/apis), this
   includes detailed per-resource and per-field level descriptions.
