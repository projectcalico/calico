title: Workload Endpoint Resource (workloadEndpoint)
---

A Workload Endpoint resource (workloadEndpoint) represents an interface 
connecting a Calico networked container or VM to its host.

Each endpoint may specify a set of labels and list of profiles that Calico will use 
to apply policy to the interface.

For `calicoctl` commands that specify a resource type on the CLI, the following
aliases are supported (all case insensitive): `workloadendpoint`, `workloadendpoints`, `wep`, `weps`.

> **Note**
>
> While `calicoctl` allows the user to fully manage Workload Endpoint resources,
the lifecylce of these resources is generally handled by an orchestrator specific 
plugin such as the Calico CNI plugin, the Calico Docker network plugin, 
or the Calico OpenStack Neutron Driver.  In general, we recommend that you only
use `calicoctl` to view this resource type.
