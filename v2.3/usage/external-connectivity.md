title: External Connectivity
---
Calico creates a routed network on which your containers look like normal IP
speakers. You can connect to them from a host in your cluster (assuming the
network policy you've assigned allows this) using their IP address.

This document discusses connectivity between Calico endpoints and hosts outside
the cluster.

## Outbound connectivity

Outbound connectivity refers to connections originating from Calico endpoints
to destinations outside the cluster.

The easiest way to get outbound connectivity is to turn on NAT Outgoing on all
Calico pools you want to be able to access the internet.

```shell
calicoctl get ipPool
```

# For each pool that needs connectivity:
```
cat << EOF | calicoctl apply -f -
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ipPool
  metadata:
    cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
  spec:
    nat-outgoing: true
EOF
```

[set `ipip:` `enabled:true` if needed]

Please note that many solutions for inbound connectivity will also provide
outbound connectivity.

## Inbound connectivity

Inbound connectivity refers to connections to Calico endpoints originating from
outside the cluster.

There are two main approaches: BGP peering into your network infrastructure, or
using orchestrator specific options.

Remember to configure your network policy to allow traffic from the internet!

### BGP peering

This requires access to BGP capable switches or routers in front of your Calico
cluster.

In general, this will involve peering the nodes in your Calico cluster with BGP
capable switches, which act as the gateway to reach Calico endpoints in the
cluster from outside.

A common scenario is for your container hosts to be on their own isolated layer
2 network, like a rack in your server room or an entire data center.  Access to
that network is via a router, which also is the default router for all the
container hosts.

See the [BGP peering document]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/usage/configuration/bgp)
for information on how to set up the Calico node sides of the sessions.
Consult the documentation for your BGP capable switch/router to set up the
switch sides of the sessions.

If you have a small number of hosts, you can configure BGP sessions between your router and each Calico-enabled host. With many hosts, you may wish to use a
route reflector or set up a Layer 3 topology.

There's further advice on network topologies in the [private cloud reference documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/).
We'd also encourage you to [get in touch](http://www.projectcalico.org/contact/)
to discuss your environment.

### Orchestrator specific

Calico supports a number of orchestrator specific options for inbound
connectivity, such as Kubernetes service IPs, or OpenStack floating IPs.

Consult the [documentation for your orchestrator]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started) for more
information.
