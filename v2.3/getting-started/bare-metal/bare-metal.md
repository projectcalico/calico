title: Using Calico to Secure Host Interfaces
---

This guide describes how to use Calico to secure the network interfaces
of the host itself (as opposed to those of any container/VM workloads
that are present on the host). We call such interfaces "host endpoints",
to distinguish them from "workload endpoints" (such as containers or VMs).

Calico supports the same rich security policy model for host endpoints
that it supports for workload endpoints.  Host endpoints can have labels, and
their labels are in the same "namespace" as those of workload endpoints. This
allows security rules for either type of endpoint to refer to the other type
(or a mix of the two) using labels and selectors.

Calico does not support setting IPs or policing MAC addresses for host
interfaces, it assumes that the interfaces are configured by the
underlying network fabric.

Calico distinguishes workload endpoints from host endpoints by a configurable
prefix.  Unless you happen to have host interfaces whose name matches the
default for that prefix (`cali`), you won't need to change it.  In case you do,
see the `InterfacePrefix` configuration value at [Configuring
Felix]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/felix/configuration).
Interfaces that start with a value listed in `InterfacePrefix` are assumed to
be workload interfaces.  Others are treated as host interfaces.

Calico blocks all traffic to/from workload interfaces by default;
allowing traffic only if the interface is known and policy is in place.
However, for host endpoints, Calico is more lenient; it only polices
traffic to/from interfaces that it's been explicitly told about. Traffic
to/from other interfaces is left alone.

As of Calico v2.1.0, Calico applies host endpoint security policy both to traffic 
that is terminated locally, and to traffic that is forwarded between host 
endpoints.  Previously, policy was only applied to traffic that was terminated 
locally.  The change allows Calico to be used to secure a NAT gateway or router.
Calico supports selector-based policy as normal when running on a gateway or router
allowing for rich, dynamic security policy based on the labels attached to your 
workloads.

## Installation overview

To make use of Calico's host endpoint support, you will need to follow
these steps, described in more detail below:

-   download the calicoctl binary
-   create an etcd cluster, if you haven't already
-   install Calico's Felix daemon on each host
-   initialize the etcd database
-   add policy to allow basic connectivity and Calico function
-   create host endpoint objects in etcd for each interface you want
    Calico to police (in a later release, we plan to support interface
    templates to remove the need to explicitly configure
    every interface)
-   insert policy into etcd for Calico to apply
-   decide whether to disable "failsafe SSH/etcd" access.

### Download the calicoctl binary

Download the calicoctl binary onto your host.

	wget {{site.data.versions[page.version].first.components.calicoctl.download_url}}
	chmod +x calicoctl

This binary should be placed in your `$PATH` so it can be run from any
directory.

## Creating an etcd cluster

If you haven't already created an etcd cluster for your Calico
deployment, you'll need to create one.

To create a single-node etcd cluster for testing, download an etcd v3.x
release from [the etcd releases archive](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases); we recommend using
the most recent bugfix release. Then follow the instructions on that
page to unpack and run the etcd binary.

To create a production cluster, you should follow the guidance in the
[etcd manual](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/). In particular, the
[clustering guide](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/).

## Installing Felix

{% include ppa_repo_name %}

There are several ways to install Felix.

-   if you are running Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04, you can install from our PPA:

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:project-calico/{{ ppa_repo_name }}
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get upgrade
        sudo apt-get install calico-felix

-   if you are running a RedHat 7-derived distribution, you can install
    from our RPM repository:

        cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/calico.repo <<EOF
        [calico]
        name=Calico Repository
        baseurl=http://binaries.projectcalico.org/rpm/{{ ppa_repo_name }}/
        enabled=1
        skip_if_unavailable=0
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=http://binaries.projectcalico.org/rpm/{{ ppa_repo_name }}/key
        priority=97
        EOF

        yum install calico-felix

-   if you are running another distribution, follow the instructions in
    [this document](bare-metal-install) to use the calico-felix binary
    directly.

-   if you want to run under docker, you can use `calicoctl node run` to start
    the calico/node container image.  This container packages up the core Calico
    components to provide both Calico networking and network policy.  Running
    the container automatically pre-initializes the etcd database (which the
    other installations methods do not).  See the
    [`calicoctl node run`]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/calicoctl/commands/node/run)
    guide for details.

Until you initialize the database, Felix will make a regular log that it
is in state "wait-for-ready". The default location for the log file is
`/var/log/calico/felix.log`.

## Initialising the etcd database

If you are using the container-based installation (using the calico/node
container image), the database is initialized as soon as you start the first
node instance.

If you are self-installed you should configure a `node` resource for each
host running Felix.  In this case, the database is initialized after
creating the first `node` resource.  For a deployment that does not include
the Calico/BGP integration, the specification of a node resource just requires
the name of the node;  for most deployments this will be the same as the
hostname.

```
cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: node
  metadata:
    name: <node name or hostname>
EOF
```

If you check the felix logfile after this step, the logs should
transition from periodic notifications that felix is in state
"wait-for-ready" to a stream of initialisation messages.

## Creating basic connectivity and Calico policy

When a host endpoint is added, if there is no security policy for that
endpoint, Calico will default to denying traffic to/from that endpoint,
except for traffic that is allowed by the [failsafe rules](#failsafe-rules).

While the [failsafe rules](#failsafe-rules) provide protection against removing all
connectivity to a host,

-   they are overly broad in allowing inbound SSH on any interface and
    allowing traffic out to etcd's ports on any interface
-   depending on your network, they may not cover all the ports that are
    required; for example, your network may reply on allowing ICMP,
    or DHCP.

Therefore, we recommend creating a failsafe Calico security policy that
is tailored to your environment. The example command below shows one
example of how you might do that; the command uses `calicoctl` to:

- Create a single policy resource, which
  - applies to all known endpoints
  - allows inbound ssh access from a defined "management" subnet
  - allows outbound connectivity to etcd on a particular IP; if
    you have multiple etcd servers you should duplicate the rule
    for each destination
  - allows inbound ICMP
  - allows outbound UDP on port 67, for DHCP.

When running this command, replace the placeholders in angle brackets with
appropriate values for your deployment.
<!-- -->

```
cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: policy
  metadata:
    name: failsafe
  spec:
    selector: "all()"
    order: 0
    ingress:
    - action: allow
      protocol: tcp
      source:
        net: "<your management CIDR>"
      destination:
        ports: [22]
    - action: allow
      protocol: icmp
    egress:
    - action: allow
      protocol: tcp
      destination:
        net: "<your etcd IP>/32"
        ports: [<your etcd ports>]
    - action: allow
      protocol: udp
      destination:
        ports: [67]
EOF
```

Once you have such a policy in place, you may want to disable the
[failsafe rules](#failsafe-rules).

## Creating host endpoint objects

For each host endpoint that you want Calico to secure, you'll need to
create a host endpoint object in etcd.  Use the `calicoctl create` command
to create a host endpoint resource (hostEndpoint).

There are two ways to specify the interface that a host endpoint should
refer to. You can either specify the name of the interface or its
expected IP address. In either case, you'll also need to know the name given to
the Calico node running on the host that owns the interface; in most cases this
will be the same as the hostname of the host.

For example, to secure the interface named `eth0` with IP 10.0.0.1 on
host `my-host`, run the command below.  The name of the endpoint is an
arbitrary name required for endpoint identification.

When running this command, replace the placeholders in angle brackets with
appropriate values for your deployment.

```
cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: hostEndpoint
  metadata:
    name: <name of endpoint>
    node: <node name or hostname>
    labels:
      role: webserver
      environment: production
  spec:
    interfaceName: eth0
    profiles: [<list of profile IDs>]
    expectedIPs: ["10.0.0.1"]
EOF
```

> **NOTE**

Where `<list of profile IDs>` is an optional list of security profiles
to apply to the endpoint and labels contains a set of arbitrary
key/value pairs that can be used in selector expressions.

<!-- TODO(smc) data-model: Link to new data model docs. -->

> **Warning**

> `expectedIPs` field to resolve label selectors

Or, if you knew that the IP address should be 10.0.0.1, but not the name
of the interface:

```
cat << EOF | calicoctl create -f -
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: hostEndpoint
  metadata:
    name: <name of endpoint>
    node: <node name or hostname>
    labels:
      role: webserver
      environment: production
  spec:
    profiles: [<list of profile IDs>]
    expectedIPs: ["10.0.0.1"]
EOF
```

After you create host endpoint objects, Felix will start policing
traffic to/from that interface. If you have no policy or profiles in
place, then you should see traffic being dropped on the interface.

> **NOTE**
>
> By default, Calico has a failsafe in place that whitelists certain
> traffic such as ssh. See below for more details on
> disabling/configuring the failsafe rules.
>

If you don't see traffic being dropped, check the hostname, IP address
and (if used) the interface name in the configuration. If there was
something wrong with the endpoint data, Felix will log a validation
error at `WARNING` level and it will ignore the endpoint:

    $ grep "Validation failed" /var/log/calico/felix.log
    2016-05-31 12:16:21,651 [WARNING][8657/3] calico.felix.fetcd 1017:
        Validation failed for host endpoint HostEndpointId<eth0>, treating as
        missing: 'name' or 'expected_ipvX_addrs' must be present.;
        '{ "labels": {"foo": "bar"}, "profile_ids": ["prof1"]}'

The error can be quite long but it should log the precise cause of the
rejection; in this case "'name' or 'expected\_ipvX\_addrs' must be
present" tells us that either the interface's name or its expected IP
address must be specified.

## Creating more security policy

We recommend using selector-based security policy with
bare-metal workloads. This allows ordered policy to be applied to
endpoints that match particular label selectors.

+For example, you could add a second policy for webserver access:

```
cat << EOF | dist/calicoctl create -f -
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: policy
  metadata:
    name: webserver
  spec:
    selector: "role==\"webserver\""
    order: 100
    ingress:
    - action: allow
      protocol: tcp
      destination:
        ports: [80]
    egress:
    - action: allow
EOF
```

## Failsafe rules

To avoid completely cutting off a host via incorrect or malformed
policy, Calico has a failsafe mechanism that keeps various pinholes open
in the firewall.

By default, Calico keeps port 22 inbound open on *all* host endpoints,
which allows access to ssh; as well as outbound communication to ports
2379, 2380, 4001 and 7001, which allows access to etcd's default ports.

The lists of failsafe ports can be configured via the configuration parameters
described in [Configuring
Felix]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/reference/felix/configuration).  They
can be disabled by setting each configuration value to "none".

> **WARNING**
>
> Removing the inbound failsafe rules can leave a host inaccessible.
>
> Removing the outbound failsafe rules can leave Felix unable to connect
> to etcd.
>
> Before disabling the failsafe rules, we recommend creating a policy to
> replace it with more-specific rules for your environment: see [above](#creating-basic-connectivity-and-calico-policy).

## Untracked policy

Policy for host endpoints can be marked as 'doNotTrack'.  This means that rules
in that policy should be applied before any data plane connection tracking, and
that packets allowed by these rules should not be tracked.

A typical scenario for using 'doNotTrack' policy would be a server, running
directly on a host, that accepts a very high rate of shortlived connections,
such as `memcached`.  On Linux, if those connections are tracked, the conntrack
table can fill up and then Linux may drop packets for further connection
attempts, meaning that those newer connections will fail.  If you are using
Calico to secure that server's host, you can avoid this problem by defining a
policy that allows access to the server's ports and is marked as 'doNotTrack'.

Since there is no connection tracking for a 'doNotTrack' policy, it is
important that the policy's ingress and egress rules are specified
symmetrically.  For example, for a server on port 999, the policy must include
an ingress rule allowing access *to* port 999 and an egress rule allowing
outbound traffic *from* port 999.  (Whereas for a connection tracked policy, it
is usually enough to specify the ingress rule only, and then connection
tracking will automatically allow the return path.)
