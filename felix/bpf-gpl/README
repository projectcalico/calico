This directory contains the source code and build system for the GPL-licensed BPF
programs that Calico uses to implement its BPF dataplane.

The build requires

- kernel headers
- libbpf
- clang 7+

The calico/go-build container image provides a suitable environment:

    docker run -e LOCAL_USER_ID=$UID --rm -v `pwd`:/bpf-gpl -w /bpf-gpl calico/go-build:v0.35-deb-cgo make clean all
