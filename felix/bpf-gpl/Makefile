# Build against libbpf and its recent copy of the kernel headers.
# We link against the user API version of the headers because they contain
# everything we need for now.
#
# Note: for headers that aren't in the libbpf include directory, we'll
# fall back on the system-installed headers. At time of writing, the versions
# of those in the go-build container are from a v4.19 kernel, which is
# older than we'd like (BPF mode went GA with v5.2 as the target). It's
# not ideal to mix headers in this way but the structure of the headers
# hasn't changed enough since v4.19 to cause problems yet (and, when
# go-build eventually gets revved to the next version of Debian, the
# situation should get better, not worse).
#
# The "proper" fix for this is to rebase go-build onto a more recent
# distribution with the right kernel headers and recent libbpf package.
# That's tricky because go-build is based on the upstream images
# from the go team, and they don't provide anything newer.
